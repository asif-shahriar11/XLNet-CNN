"Willingness of health-professions students to treat patients with AIDS.
 This 1988-89 survey of 319 students in the medical, dental, nursing, and allied health-care professions revealed that over one-third had some reservations about treating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients.
 Most were unwilling to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on patients with AIDS, and most also believed that health-care workers had the right to refuse care to AIDS patients.
 Unwillingness to treat AIDS patients was strongly associated with homophobic attitudes and concerns that patients with AIDS posed a risk to health professionals.
 AIDS education for health professionals should emphasize methods for the prevention of HIV infection among health workers, and include teaching strategies designed to deal with the irrational feelings that AIDS often engenders.

"Childhood injuries: where we are.
 In this paper we present the leading causes of fatal childhood injury in the United States.
 We examine three types of explanations for why injury rates are so high in the United States compared with what they could be and actually are in a number of industrialized European countries.
 Our conclusions are based on what we learn when we look at specific injury problems and apply that knowledge to the field of childhood-injury prevention as a whole.
 To decrease the number of fatal injuries to children, we should: 1.
 Recognize injuries as a major public health problem.
 Injuries have been perceived not as problems to be solved but as ""accidents"" which are determined by fate, not understandable, and consequently not preventable.
 In addition, injuries have not been addressed in the multidisciplinary fashion that typifies the successful public health approach to other problems.
 2.
 Address intentional injury as part of the problem.
 Intentional injury has been treated as a separate field entirely and not addressed scientifically as a public health problem.
 One consequence of this is that injuries due to firearms have been addressed most frequently as a problem of ""unintentional injury."" As a result, 93% of all firearm injuries, ie, those which are intentional, have not been studied or addressed adequately.
 This situation is like studying motor vehicle injuries but excluding drunk driving and speeding as contributing factors, or like studying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but ignoring anal intercourse or intravenous drug use.
 3.
 Develop and support organizations that can plan and coordinate effectively a national approach to injury control.

"Measurements of right ventricular volumes during fluid challenge.
 The effects of fluid loading on RV function were studied in 41 acutely ill patients monitored with a modified pulmonary artery catheter equipped for measuring RVef.
 Hemodynamic evaluation was performed before and after infusion of 300 ml of 4.5 percent albumin solution in 30 min.
 Changes in SI did not correlate with Pra or Ppao but did with RVEDVI.
 For the entire group, RVef was unchanged (27 +/- 9 vs 27 +/- 9 percent).
 In the eight patients with an initial RVEDVI greater than 140 ml/m2, the fluid challenge increased Pra and Ppao and reduced LVSWI without any other significant effect.
 There was no significant correlation between RVEDVI and Pra and only a weak correlation between RVESVI and Ppa.
 However, there was a highly linear correlation between both RVEDVI and RVESVI and changes in RVEDVI and in RVESVI, suggesting that in the absence of severe pulmonary hypertension RV output is primarily dependent on RV preload.

"Trochanteric fractures. Mobility, complications, and mortality in 607 cases treated with the sliding-screw technique.
 Six hundred seven trochanteric fractures (563 patients) were treated with a sliding-screw technique and followed clinically and roentgenographically for at least one year.
 Of 351 patients admitted from their homes, 209 (60%) were discharged to their homes after an average of 18 days in the hospital.
 During the first year another 61 (17%) patients returned home after rehabilitation in a geriatric ward.
 Of 446 patients walking without support or with one cane before surgery, 360 (80%) had regained the same mobility after one year.
 The one-year mortality rate was 18%, while the ten-year rate was 74%.
 Compared with a control cohort, the mortality rate was increased during the first two years after fracture.
 The increase in mortality was influenced by advanced age, admission from long-term care institutions, male gender, and ambulatory or nonambulatory status before surgery.
 Forty-five (7.4%) were reoperated, 17 because of technical complications, three because of infection, and three because of nonunion.
 No further nonunions occurred.
 The deep infection rate was nine of 339 (2.7%) before and two of 268 (0.8%) after the introduction of antibiotic prophylaxis.
 Thromboembolic complications decreased from 4.1% to 1.2% after the introduction of dextran 70 as thromboembolic prophylaxis.

"Isolated erythroid hypoplasia and renal insufficiency induced by long-term griseofulvin therapy.
 We describe a patient with hematuria, pyuria, eosinophiluria, decreased renal function, and severe anemia that developed while she was receiving chronic therapy with griseofulvin for onychomycosis.
 We offer evidence that griseofulvin can cause an isolated erythroid hypoplasia and possibly an allergic interstitial nephritis.
 This is the first documented case of the above entities induced by the agent.
 We would recommend, based on our report, that otherwise healthy patients, when maintained on the drug for extended periods of time, have periodic determinations of renal function and hematologic status.
 As drug-induced erythroid hypoplasia typically occurs after a relatively long period of dosing, it may be prudent in certain individuals to monitor the CBC at approximately bimonthly intervals after initiation of therapy.
 Recommendations regarding monitoring of renal function are more difficult, as acute allergic interstitial nephritis can occur after either short- or long-term exposure to certain drugs.

"Genetic and familial predisposition to eclampsia and pre-eclampsia in a defined population.
 Familial predisposition and patterns of genetic inheritance of eclampsia and pre-eclampsia were investigated through three or four generations in 94 families from the homogenous island population of Iceland.
 The families descended from index women delivered in the years 1931-47 and who had either eclampsia (n = 38) or severe pre-eclampsia (n = 69).
 Inheritance was followed both through sons and daughters.
 The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in daughters was significantly higher (23%) than that in daughters-in-law (10%).
 No difference was noted in the prevalence of these diseases by whether the daughter was born of an eclamptic or pre-eclamptic mother or whether she was a first or later born daughter.
 There was a non-significantly higher occurrence of pre-eclampsia among grand-daughters than in grand-daughters-in-law.
 No difference was seen by whether grand-daughters descended through sons or daughters.
 With increasing numbers of affected daughters or grand-daughters the probability rose of finding more affected women in a family.
 Hypotheses of single recessive and dominant gene inheritance were compared and maximum likelihood estimates for gene frequency obtained.
 For a single recessive gene model this was 0.31 reflecting a population prevalence of 9.6%, whereas a dominant model with incomplete penetrance gave 0.14 at 48% gene penetrance, corresponding to a population prevalence of 0.9% homozygous expression of severe disease and 11% heterozygous expression of milder disease.
 Either genetic model could fit the data.

"Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation: current status of total artificial heart in 1989 and determinants of survival.
 Since April 1986, 40 total artificial hearts (TAH) were implanted as a bridge to transplantation in our institution.
 In an attempt to identify factors affecting survival of TAH recipients we reviewed our experience over 1000 days of mechanical support.
 There was no postoperative bleeding requiring surgery nor were there any clinical episodes of thromboembolic complications.
 Over a total functioning period greater than 3 years there were no mechanical failures in the driving system but one artificial ventricle had to be replaced because of mechanical dysfunction.
 Infections and multiple organ failure were the primary causes of morbidity and mortality during mechanical support.
 When the patients who underwent staged transplantation (no.
 17) were compared with those who died during mechanical support (no.
 23) there were no differences in TAH driving mode or hemodynamic variables between the groups.
 Although preoperative pulmonary, hepatic and renal functions were found to be similar between the groups, there were significant differences in the early evolution (3 days) of hepatic and renal functions following TAH implant (p less than 0.01).
 Urinary output was found to be the earliest variable discriminating recovery and survival (p less than 0.01).
 Finally, univariate analysis indicated age (less than 40 vs greater than 40 years) and modality of cardiac decompensation (acute vs chronic) as the most important factors affecting survival after TAH implantation.
 Since young patients (less than 40 years of age) with acute decompensation were successfully transplanted in 82% of cases while 100% of older patients with chronic decompensation died before or after transplantation, TAH should be advised in young patients with acute or chronic heart failure and in selected older candidates with recent, acute cardiac failure.

"Aneurysmal dilatation in saphenous vein bypass grafts.
 Three patients are reported who developed aneurysmal degeneration of a saphenous vein arterial bypass graft.
 All three had hypercholesterolemia and two had marked elevation of triglycerides.
 One bypass was for occlusive disease and two for popliteal aneurysm.
 There was a long lag, 3 to 7 years between graft implantation and aneurysmal degeneration.
 The pathology was similar for all three cases with lipid laden macrophages, loss of elastic lamina, and other atherosclerotic changes in the vein wall.
 While atheromatous changes and aneurysm formation in saphenous vein bypass grafts are rare, this may occur especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
 Careful and prolonged follow-up plus vigorous management of the hyperlipidemic state is mandatory in these patients.

 The Conference is also a public forum for political and social discussion and serves as a barometer of scientific and social trends as well.
 This year's conference featured refinements in clinical care, a deeper understanding of the epidemiologic trends, and a public awareness of the many political aspects of the AIDS epidemic.

"An elliptical incised wound of the breast misinterpreted as a bite injury.
 Bite injuries upon homicide victims are most often initially identified by the forensic pathologist during the course of the autopsy examination.
 Following such recognition, the injury or photographs of the traumatized site are then referred to a forensic odontologist for his or her examination, further characterization, and subsequent comparison with any suspect's dentition.
 However, if the pathologist misidentifies an injury caused by another mechanism as a human bite, this mistake can potentially be perpetuated by the dental consultant, since relatively few dentists regularly examine traumatic injuries other than those arising from bites.
 To illustrate such an event, a case is presented involving an incised wound of the breast, which was originally identified as an avulsive bite wound.
 Detailed examination by two odontologic consultants confirmed the wound as having been caused by human teeth, and further, they related the ""bite injury"" to a specific individual.
 The bite injury interpretation represented the only scientific evidence implicating the suspect at a subsequent trial for capital murder.
 Later examination of the tissues and photographs by a forensic pathologist and another dental consultant revealed that the injury was not due to human dentition, but rather resulted from a sharp-edged instrument.
 These consultants conducted a unique experiment to reduplicate the injury and prove its causation.
 This information was presented to the jury during the suspect's trial and resulted in his acquittal on all charges.

"Pleuritis as a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis.
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency with which tuberculous pleuritis is a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis and to compare the clinical manifestations of reactivation tuberculous pleuritis with ""classic"" tuberculous pleuritis, in which chest roentgenograms reveal no parenchymal infiltrates.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated the medical records of 59 patients in whom tuberculous pleuritis was confirmed by histologic findings or mycobacterial culture.
 Twenty-seven patients (46%) had typical chest roentgenographic findings of reactivation tuberculosis, whereas 32 (54%) had classic tuberculous pleuritis.
 The clinical and laboratory features of these two groups were compared.
 RESULTS: Symptoms were more prolonged and pleural fluid glucose and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations were more markedly abnormal in patients with reactivation pleuritis than in those with classic pleuritis, suggesting a more chronic inflammatory process in the former group.
 Compared with patients with classic tuberculous pleuritis, those with reactivation pleuritis had a lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests (61% versus 88%) and granulomatous pleural inflammation (25% versus 72%), but a higher bacillary burden, manifest by a higher frequency of positive sputum smears for acid-fast bacilli (50% versus 0%) and positive mycobacterial cultures from sputum (60% versus 23%) and pleural fluid (91% versus 66%).
 CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, tuberculous pleuritis was a manifestation of reactivation tuberculosis in 46% (27 of 59) of patients.
 Tuberculous pleuritis is a more chronic process in patients with reactivation disease than in those with classic pleuritis.
 The lower frequency of reactive tuberculin skin tests and granuloma formation, combined with the higher bacillary burden in patients with reactivation pleuritis, suggest that these patients mount a less effective immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection than do patients with the classic form of tuberculous pleuritis.

"Evaluation of methods for detecting venous reflux. Perspectives in venous insufficiency.
 Using 793 limbs with nonobstructive venous reflux, we evaluated a number of techniques used for the assessment of venous reflux.
 The venous Doppler examination was found to be a reliable screening tool with excellent sensitivity and good specificity.
 Photoplethysmography was 97% sensitive in patients with ambulatory venous hypertension; however, in milder forms of reflux, it was less sensitive.
 The major drawback of photoplethysmography was the large number of false-positive results obtained.
 Ambulatory venous pressure measurement and another pressure-based technique, Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure measurement, defined overlapping but different normal and abnormal limbs.
 Descending venography, when performed as described by Kistner et al, was found to be a reliable tool to assess reflux with more than a 90% sensitivity.
 The horizontal technique of performing descending venography and nucleotide descending venographies had unacceptably low sensitivity and were abandoned.
 Features of venous reflux as outlined by these modern technical tools are described.

"Sudden death in young competitive athletes: clinicopathologic correlations in 22 cases.
 PURPOSE: To investigate the pathologic substrates of sudden death in young competitive athletes.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two cases of sudden death in young competitive athletes occurring in the Veneto region (northern Italy) in the period January 1979 to December 1989 were studied by postmortem examination.
 The athletes included 19 males and three females, ranging in age from 11 to 35 years (mean, 23 years).
 RESULTS: In 18 cases, sudden death occurred during (16 cases) or immediately after (two cases) a competitive sport activity.
 In 10 subjects, sudden death was apparently the first sign of disease.
 Postmortem examination disclosed that this fatality was due to arrhythmic cardiac arrest in 17 cases; among these, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, also known as ""right ventricular dysplasia,"" was the most frequently encountered cardiovascular disease (six cases), followed by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (four cases), conduction system pathology (three cases), anomalous origin of right coronary artery from the wrong aortic sinus (two cases), and mitral valve prolapse (two cases).
 In two athletes, the abrupt lethal complication was ""mechanical"" and consisted of pulmonary embolism and rupture of the aorta; in three athletes, death was due to a cerebral cause.
 All athletes with right ventricular cardiomyopathy died during effort, and most had a history of palpitations and/or syncope.
 Whenever available, electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings showed inverted T waves in precordial leads and/or left bundle branch block ventricular arrhythmias.
 CONCLUSIONS: Clinicopathologic correlations indicate that in the Veneto region of Italy, right ventricular cardiomyopathy is not so rare among the cardiovascular diseases associated with the risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest, and seems to account for the majority of cases of sudden death in young athletes; this disorder can be suspected during life on the basis of prodromal symptoms and ECG signs.

"Intestinal metaplasia is age related in Barrett's esophagus.
 The correlation among cellular characteristics of Barrett's esophagus, patient age, and malignant neoplasm is not well documented.
 This study, which describes a population of 66 patients with Barrett's esophagus spanning 1 to 80 years of age, analyzes the cellular constituents of their lesional tissues by endoscopic biopsy and histochemical and morphometric studies.
 Goblet cell metaplasia, identified in 50% (n = 14) of pediatric patients, increased significantly to involve 84% (n = 32) of biopsy specimens from adult patients with Barrett's esophagus.
 This increase was exponential by linear regression analysis (R2 = .64) between the ages of 5 and 29 years.
 Pediatric patients usually had 25 or less goblet cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa with no identifiable epithelial dysplasia or cancer; Nissen fundoplication lessened esophageal inflammation, but the Barrett mucosa persisted.
 Goblet cell metaplasia maintained a plateau (mean of 57 cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa) between the ages of 41 and 80 years.
 Dysplasia, in situ carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma was found in patients with Barrett's esophagus who were aged 41 years or older.
 This study demonstrates persistence of Barrett mucosa, increased incidence of goblet cell metaplasia, and predictable changes in goblet cell number with advancing patient age.
 The relationship between Barrett mucosa and malignant neoplasm remains uncertain, but the goblet cell may serve as a marker of disease chronicity in which setting neoplasia evolves.

"Echinococcus infestation of the biceps brachii. A case report.
 Echinococcus is a genus of tapeworm endemic in certain parts of the world but found only rarely in the United States.
 An extremely unusual case of an intramuscular infestation involving an extremity occurred in a 41-year-old man.
 Since the infestation closely resembled a soft-tissue tumor on clinical and roentgenographic examination, the patient was treated with an incisional biopsy of the mass, which consisted of a cystic cavity filled with clear fluid.
 The diagnosis of an Echinococcus cyst was made only after permanent section analysis revealed numerous scoleces within the cyst lining.
 The patient was asymptomatic six months after cyst excision but still remains at risk for recurrence of the infestation.
 The present report serves to alert the reader to this rare but potentially fatal condition.
 Preoperative diagnosis is imperative to avoid inadvertant rupture of a hydatid cyst, which releases viable scoleces into the systemic circulation and may precipitate an anaphylactic reaction.

"A limited diagnostic investigation for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Oximetry and static charge sensitive bed.
 A simplified sleep apnea investigation consisting of combined oximetry and respiration movement monitoring was compared with conventional polysomnography.
 These two types of recordings were performed simultaneously during one night in 77 patients with suspected obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
 A static charge sensitive bed (SCSB) was used in the simplified recording because it provides a comfortable and reliable means of recording respiration movements.
 Periods of obstructive apneas gave a diamond-shaped periodic respiration movement pattern in the SCSB, usually accompanied by repetitive oxygen desaturations.
 The average number of desaturations greater than or equal to 4 percent per sleeping hour was termed the oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and compared with the apnea index (AI).
 In the whole population they were well correlated (p less than 0.0001, R2 = 0.41), but in individual cases there were considerable discrepancies.
 Patients with periodic respiration movements less than 18 percent of total sleeping time and ODI less than 2 never had AI greater than or equal to 5, whereas patients with periodic respiration greater than 45 percent and ODI greater than 6 always had AI greater than or equal to 5.
 Fifty-one of the 77 patients fulfilled these criteria.
 A bradycardia response to apneas was absent in 29 percent of patients with AI greater than or equal to 5.
 A combination of respiration movement and oximetry recording thus seems to give sufficient information to confirm or negate a diagnosis of OSAS in a majority of patients with clinical symptoms.
 In borderline patients, further investigations should be performed.

"Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist reduces mortality from endotoxin shock.
 About five out of 1,000 patients admitted to hospital develop bacterial sepsis leading to shock, the mortality rate for which is high despite antibiotic therapy.
 The infection results in hypotension and poor tissue perfusion, and eventually leads to the failure of several organ systems.
 Bacterial endotoxin is thought to be the direct cause of shock in Gram-negative sepsis, because it can cause shock in animals, and antibodies against endotoxin prevent Gram-negative shock in animals and in humans.
 But, the symptoms of septic shock are the result of the actions of host cytokines induced by the endotoxin.
 The cytokine interleukin-1 has been implicated as an important mediator of septic shock because it can induce tachycardia and hypotension and act synergistically with tumour necrosis factor to cause tissue damage and death.
 We now report that a specific interleukin-1 receptor antagonist reduces the lethality of endotoxin-induced shock in rabbits, indicating that interleukin-1 does indeed play an important part in endotoxin shock.

"Trimming of the inferior turbinates: a prospective long-term study.
 The aim of this study was to determine whether the initial benefits of radical trimming and anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates on nasal airflow persisted in the long term.
 Radical trimming significantly reduced nasal resistance at 2 months following operation (n = 12) (P less than 0.005).
 There was no significant change in nasal resistance over the next 20 months.
 Symptom scores for nasal obstruction also showed a significant reduction (n = 16) (P less than 0.005), at 2 months, and did not change significantly over the next 20 months.
 Radical trimming of the inferior turbinates is a highly effective operation in patients with hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates with few initial complications.
 However, further analysis of the data revealed that up to 20% of patients lose the initial subjective benefit of relief of nasal obstruction within 2 years of follow-up.
 Late onset crusting occurs in some patients though this is not directly attributable to an increase in nasal airflow.
 This study also concludes that anterior trimming of the inferior turbinates cannot be recommended as a form of treatment.

 A novel X-linked combined immunodeficiency disease was found in five living males in an extended family in the United States.
 The age of the affected males ranged from 2.5 to 34 yr.
 The most prominent clinical abnormalities were a paucity of lymphoid tissue; recurrent sinusitis, otitis media, bronchitis, and pneumonia; severe varicella; and chronic papillomavirus infections.
 The principal immunologic features of the disorder were normal concentrations of serum immunoglobulins but restricted formation of IgG antibodies to immunogens; normal numbers of B cells and NK cells but decreased numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, particularly the CD45RA+ subpopulations; diminished proliferative responses of blood T cells to allogeneic cells, mitogens and antigens; and decreased production of IL-2 by mitogen stimulated blood lymphocytes.
 Thus, affected males in this family carry an abnormal gene on their X chromosome that results in a combined immunodeficiency that is distinct from previously reported disorders.

"The potential of 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for the detection of tumor involvement in lymph nodes.
 To assess the potential of FDG for PET imaging of nodal tumor metastases, we evaluated its uptake into normal lymph nodes, tumor-involved lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tumor xenografts in rodents.
 Normal lymph nodes in mice and rats accumulate FDG moderately, developing node/blood ratios of 1.3-11.9/1 at 2 hr following i.v.
 injection.
 By contrast, FDG given subcutaneously to healthy Sprague Dawley rats developed very high normal draining lymph node/blood ratios (272/1) versus 7.7/1 by i.v.
 injection.
 In nude mice, subcutaneous human ovarian cancer xenografts had 1.27-fold more uptake relative to blood than did normal popliteal lymph nodes.
 Subcutaneous tumor xenografts of rat breast cancer developed tumor/normal node uptake ratios of 4.91 +/- 0.43/1 and tumor/blood ratios of 6.6 +/- 0.9 at 2 hr postinjection.
 Mouse nodes involved with 38C13 murine B-cell lymphoma had mean node/blood ratios of 42.9 +/- 6.7/1 and tumored node/normal lymph node uptake of 6.3/1.
 Thus, FDG given intravenously but not subcutaneusly (due to high normal nodal uptake) has potential as an agent for the detection of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes using PET scanning.

"Use of pulmonary artery catheters in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Analysis of experience in 5,841 patients in the SPRINT Registry. SPRINT Study Group 
 This study analyzes the use of PAC in a registry comprising 5,841 hospitalized patients with AMI.
 A total of 371 patients received PAC.
 In-hospital mortality was higher in patients with CHF who received PAC, while there was no difference in patients with cardiogenic shock or persistent hypotension.
 Mortality in patients receiving PAC was higher irrespective of the presence or absence of ""pump failure."" A separate analysis of discharge summaries of 364 patients with CHF showed that PAC was used more frequently in sicker patients and that when severity of CHF was assessed, no difference in mortality was found in patients with mild or moderate CHF.
 We conclude that while a higher in-hospital mortality is found in patients receiving PAC, this excess is likely related to difference in severity of CHF, which had not been assessed in every individual.
 It is unlikely that PAC increases mortality.

"The in vivo biologic effect of interleukin 2 and interferon alfa on natural immunity in patients with head and neck cancer.
 Given the association of deficient natural immunity with the risk of metastatic disease, the ability to activate natural killer cell function may have a therapeutic significance.
 The effect of continuous infusion of interleukin 2 plus intramuscular interferon alfa on natural immune status was, therefore, analyzed in eight patients with head and neck cancer.
 Also evaluated was the effect of interleukin 2-interferon alfa therapy on lymphokine-activated killer cell activity as well as total lymphocyte count, percent of lymphocyte subsets, and levels of both circulating immune complexes and antibody classes.
 Both the percent and absolute number of natural killer cells (ie, CD56+ CD3- lymphocytes) within peripheral blood as well as natural killer cell activity against K562 targets increased significantly with treatment.
 The remaining immune parameters were not significantly altered.
 The demonstrated capacity to modulate natural immune function supports the potential use of interleukin 2-containing regimens as a preventive measure against metastatic disease in patients with head and neck cancer.

"Biliary and gut function following shock.
 The aim of this study was to characterize the alterations in gallbladder and intestinal function after hemorrhagic shock and blood reperfusion in opossums.
 Animals were subjected to a shock of 30 mm Hg of arterial blood pressure for 60 minutes and resuscitated with blood reinfusion.
 Gallbladder epithelial ion transport, gallbladder motility in vitro and in vivo, gastrointestinal motility, and flora of the stomach and small bowel were studied 2 and 24 hours after shock.
 Changes at 2 hours included decreased gallbladder contractility in vitro and decreased emptying in vivo, loss of coordination with intestinal motor activity, decrease in frequency of intestinal electrical slow waves, and reduced duration of the intestinal migrating motor complex cycle.
 By 24 hours, gallbladder epithelial permeability was increased and in vitro contractility remained reduced but the in vivo functions showed partial recovery.
 Gastrointestinal flora was not affected by these changes.
 These data demonstrate that hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion affect digestive motility.
 The early timing of the alterations observed and the partial recovery 24 hours post shock suggest an ischemia-hypoxia mechanism of injury.

"The physical state of human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
 Cervical carcinomas and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using Southern blot hybridization.
 Of the five HPV types examined (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33), HPV 16 DNA was detected most frequently.
 In most HPV 16-positive carcinomas examined, HPV 16 DNA was present in an integrated state in cellular DNA with or without the coexistence of episomal species.
 In one case, however, only episomal species were detected.
 Among seven cases of HPV 16-positive CIN, four contained HPV 16 DNA only in the episomal state and the rest contained HPV 16 DNA only in the integrated state, but the coexistence of both states was not found.
 These results suggest that the integration of HPV 16 DNA is not necessary for cells to become malignant, although it is frequently associated with malignant cells.

"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on the relation between initial ST-predicted size and final QRS-estimated size of acute myocardial infarcts.
 Thrombolytic therapy has been documented to reduce acute myocardial infarct size.
 The previously established relation between initial ST segment elevation and final electrocardiographic (ECG) myocardial infarct size in patients without coronary reperfusion might therefore be altered by thrombolytic therapy.
 The effect of intravenous streptokinase on this relation was therefore studied in 73 patients with initial acute myocardial infarction who had participated in the Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2).
 Patients who received streptokinase were considered as one group and patients who did not receive streptokinase as a control group.
 Final myocardial infarct size, which was estimated from the QRS score, was predicted from the admission standard ECG by previously developed formulas based on ST segment elevation.
 In the 40 control patients there was no change from ST-predicted to final QRS-estimated infarct size (median 17.7% versus 18.3%; p = NS).
 In the 33 patients in the streptokinase group, there was a highly significant decrease from predicted to final myocardial infarct size (median 21.9% versus 16.2%; p less than 0.0002).
 This decrease was found for both anterior (median 23.7% versus 19.5%; p less than 0.03) and inferior (median 21.9% versus 12.0%; p = 0.001) infarct locations.
 Multiple regression analysis adjusting for differences in predicted infarct size confirmed the significance of streptokinase on the difference in infarct size (p = 0.006).
 Based on the variability of the percent change from predicted to final infarct size in the control group, a threshold decrease greater than or equal to 20% is required for identification of salvage.

"Effect of diltiazem and thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) on vessels following experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 In order to examine the functional changes in the vascular smooth muscle, the effects of a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor (OKY-046) and a calcium channel blocker (diltiazem) on vessels following subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the contractile activity of cerebral vessels with various vasoactive agents, were investigated by studying isometric tension recordings in rings of cat basilar artery.
 The maximum contractile activities of the vessels in response to noradrenalin and adrenaline during the course of subarachnoid hemorrhage were significantly less than those in the control group.
 On the other hand, the maximum contractile activity of the vessels in response to prostaglandin F2 alpha on the seventh day following subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly augmented compared with that in the control group.
 A significant decline in the relaxation of responsiveness to diltiazem during the course of subarachnoid hemorrhage was observed compared with that of diltiazem in the control group.
 This responsiveness to vasoactive agents was not influenced by the application of OKY-046.
 The present study reveals functional changes in vascular smooth muscle exposed to subarachnoid hemorrhage in response to vasoactive agents and a calcium entry blocker.
 Thromboxane A2 may not be a significantly influential factor in the present results.
 It is suggested that cerebral vasospasm may well be related to functional changes of the arterial wall, which appear to be associated with derangement of the mechanisms of smooth muscle constriction and dilatation based on organic changes.

"Steroids induce acetylcholine receptors on cultured human muscle: implications for myasthenia gravis.
 Antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), which are diagnostic of the human autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis, block AChR function and increase the rate of AChR degradation leading to impaired neuromuscular transmission.
 Steroids are frequently used to alleviate symptoms of muscle fatigue and weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis because of their well-documented immunosuppressive effects.
 We show here that the steroid dexamethasone significantly increases total surface AChRs on cultured human muscle exposed to myasthenia gravis sera.
 Our results suggest that the clinical improvement observed in myasthenic patients treated with steroids is due not only to an effect on the immune system but also to a direct effect on muscle.
 We propose that the identification and development of pharmacologic agents that augment receptors and other proteins that are reduced by human genetic or autoimmune disease will have broad therapeutic applications.

"Simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing and transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography: a new method of stress echocardiography 
 The diagnostic use of exercise echocardiography has been widely reported.
 However, transthoracic exercise echocardiography is inadequate in up to 20% of patients because of poor image quality related to exercise.
 In an attempt to overcome these limitations, a system was developed in which transesophageal echocardiography is combined with simultaneous transesophageal atrial pacing by means of the same probe.
 In a prospective study, transesophageal echocardiography was performed before, during and immediately after maximal atrial pacing in 50 patients with suspected coronary artery disease.
 Results of transesophageal stress echocardiography were considered abnormal when new pacing-induced regional wall motion abnormalities were observed.
 Correlative routine bicycle exercise testing was carried out in 44 patients.
 Cardiac catheterization was performed in all patients.
 The success rate in obtaining high quality diagnostic images was 100% by transesophageal echocardiography.
 All nine patients without angiographic evidence of coronary artery disease had a normal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (100% specificity).
 Thirty-eight of 41 patients with coronary artery disease (defined as greater than or equal to 50% luminal diameter narrowing of at least one major vessel) had an abnormal result on the transesophageal stress echocardiogram (93% sensitivity).
 The sensitivity of the technique for one, two or three vessel disease was 85%, 100% and 100%, respectively, compared with 44%, 50% and 83%, respectively, for bicycle exercise testing; the 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) during rapid atrial pacing showed a sensitivity of 25%, 64% and 86%, respectively.
 Thus, rapid atrial pacing combined with simultaneous transesophageal echocardiography is a highly specific and sensitive technique for the detection of coronary artery disease.
 Ischemia-induced wall motion abnormalities were detected earlier than observed ECG changes.
 The technique appears to be particularly suited to patients who are unable to perform an active stress test or those with poor quality transthoracic echocardiograms.

 This article summarizes case reports, population studies, and experimental studies from the literature concerning adverse effects of exposure to iodine from the mid-1880s to 1988.
 Exposure to excessive iodine through foods, dietary supplements, topical medications, and/or iodinated contrast media has resulted in thyroiditis, goiter, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, sensitivity reactions, or acute responses for some individuals.
 Reports of maternal iodine exposure during pregnancy or lactation affecting newborn or nursing infants are cited.
 Susceptibility to excess iodine is discussed as well as the relationship between dose and response.
 It is concluded that some individuals can tolerate very high levels of iodine with no apparent side effects and that iodine intakes less than or equal to 1.000 mg/day are probably safe for the majority of the population, but may cause adverse effects in some individuals.
 Determination of maximum tolerable levels of iodine intake will require human experimental studies at levels between 0.150 and 1.000 mg/day for normal subjects, subjects with autonomous thyroid tissue, and iodine-sensitive subjects.

"Trends in primary breast cancer management. Where are we going?
 The treatment of cancer during any period has been based not on the whim of a clinician but on the therapeutic consequences of the dominant biologic model of the disease.
 Until the 1960s, the dominant model of breast cancer was of a disease that spread centrifugally along anatomic pathways, with time being the only determinant of prognosis.
 An alternative model, that of biologic determinism, posits that the outcomes of treatment are determined by the extent of microscopic dissemination that occurred before the tumor became detectable.
 This model, too, has flaws, and the author suggests that it is time for a Kuhnian paradigm shift.
 Breast cancer exhibits a heterogeneity of phenotypes resulting from one or perhaps two mutations.
 The multiple prognostic variables may be epiphenomena, expressing different degrees of amplification of a limited domain of the genome.

 The abnormal growth and differentiation in psoriasis is reflected in the abnormal regulation of Epidermal Growth Factor/Transforming Growth Factor Alpha (EGF/TGF alpha) receptor metabolism.
 In psoriasis and other hyperproliferative skin conditions these receptors are persistently expressed throughout the interfollicular epidermis as long as the growth stimulatory signal persists.
 One of the first biochemical signs of effective therapy of psoriasis is the return of the EGF/TGF alpha receptor pattern toward the primarily basilar distribution seen in normal human adult skin.
 Whether the abnormal expression of TGF alpha in the involved skin induces the persistent expression of EGF receptors is not known nor is the signal that causes the increased production of TGF alpha.

 Whether the presence of ICA is an absolute contraindication to being a kidney donor could be debated.
 Nonetheless, ICA should be used as a screening test to identify individuals at risk for subsequent IDDM.
 For those found to be positive, counseling should be provided.

"Hypertension as a risk factor for epilepsy after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and surgery.
 A prospective, consecutive series of 307 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ranging from Grades 1 to V according to the classification of Hunt and Hess on admission were evaluated to determine the incidence of epilepsy 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and surgery.
 Sixty-three patients had died and one patient was lost to follow-up.
 Twenty-nine patients developed epileptic seizures after the SAH and surgery.
 The mean time from the SAH to epileptic seizure varied from 0 days (day of the SAH) to 2 years (mean, 6.7 months).
 The seizures were classified as focal in 9 patients (31%) and as generalized in 20 patients (69%).
 All patients received anticonvulsant medication after more than one seizure.
 The risk factors for development of posthemorrhagic/postoperative epilepsy were, in order of importance: a history of hypertension; an infarct on late computed tomographic scan; and the duration of coma after the ictus.
 Of the 85 patients with histories of hypertension, 17 (20.0%) developed epilepsy.
 Only 12 (5.4%) of the 222 nonhypertensive patients developed epileptic seizures.
 The difference between the groups was significant (P = 0.0001).
 Computed tomographic scans were undertaken in 237 patients 1 to 3 years (mean, 1.4 years) after the SAH and surgery.
 Postoperative epilepsy was significantly associated with infarcts visualized on computed tomographic scan (P = 0.0005).

"Vascular and calcemic effects of plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Circulating substances that increase intracellular calcium, and other circulating substances that increase blood pressure, have been described in hypertensive animals and humans.
 In this study, we report the existence of a factor of the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats that does both.
 These effects were dose-dependent, and the time course for such effects was correlated with the time course for potentiation of pressor agents by the plasma.
 In addition, the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats was found to inhibit the depressor effects of parathyroid hormone.
 Our results confirm the presence of a circulating hypertensive factor in the plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats, which may act by increasing calcium uptake in vascular smooth muscle.
 These findings may also help explain the secondary increase in parathyroid hormone noted in some forms of human and experimental hypertension.

"Abnormal cardiac sensitivity in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries.
 The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial.
 Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization.
 Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001).
 None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests.
 Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing.
 Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli.
 This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain.
 The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown.

"Chloroprocaine antagonism of epidural opioid analgesia: a receptor-specific phenomenon?
 Sixty healthy patients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery under epidural anesthesia were randomized to receive either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine as the primary local anesthetic agent.
 When patients first complained of postoperative pain in the recovery room, they were given either fentanyl 50 micrograms or butorphanol 2 mg, epidurally, in a randomized, blinded fashion.
 Postoperative analgesia, quantitated on a visual analogue scale, as well as time elapsed until first request for supplemental opioid, did not differ for patients receiving butorphanol after either 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine anesthesia.
 In contrast, epidural fentanyl produced a shorter and lesser degree of sensory analgesia after 2-chloroprocaine use, whereas epidural fentanyl after lidocaine anesthesia provided pain relief similar to that seen in the butorphanol groups.
 Side effects were limited to somnolence with butorphanol and pruritus with fentanyl.
 No evidence of respiratory depression was seen in any patient.
 We conclude that 2 mg of butorphanol epidurally provides approximately 2 to 3 h of effective analgesia after cesarean delivery with either lidocaine or 2-chloroprocaine anesthesia.
 Epidural fentanyl seems to be antagonized when 2-chloroprocaine, but not lidocaine, is used as the primary local anesthetic agent.
 We suggest a possible mu-receptor-specific etiology for this effect.

"Demonstration of Lipiodol in paraffin sections using a modified silver impregnation technique.
 To demonstrate postangiographic Lipiodol (LIP) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in paraffin sections, direct impregnation of formalin-fixed tissue blocks with silver nitrate (AgNO3) was followed by routine processing.
 LIP appeared as black globules in the sinusoids.
 Ninety-four tissue blocks from 13 postangiographic LIP HCCs and 69 from 8 non-LIP HCCs and 4 fatty livers were studied.
 Seventy-two of 73 negative controls and all positive blocks as seen on soft tissue radiographs (STRs) were correctly coded (specificity 98.6%, sensitivity 100%).
 Twenty-six of the 44 LIP-negative areas on STRs from LIP cases contained scanty globules of less than 10 microns in diameter.
 Fatty change gave no positive readings.
 Thus, modified AgNO3 impregnation is a simple, accurate means of detecting LIP in high-quality paraffin sections suitable for tumor diagnosis and, if applied to postangiographic LIP, ultrasonographically guided liver biopsy, can verify that a biopsy has reached a suspected tumor focus.

"Gastric contents retained in rat stomach following mild irritant exposure contribute to adaptive cytoprotection.
 Fluid retained in the gastric lumen immediately preceding the administration of a damaging product will dilute that product and decrease its injurious capacity.
 In an attempt to explain the phenomenon of adaptive cytoprotection, we studied the effect of mild irritant exposure on the volume of fluid retained in the gastric lumen.
 Rats treated with 0.2 N-0.4 N HCl had a larger volume of gastric fluid retained as compared to animals treated with 0.4 N NaCl.
 Additionally, a mixture of gastric juice derived from rats exposed to 0.4 N HCl with 2 ml ethanol was significantly less damaging to the gastric mucosa than a similar mixture containing an equal volume of gastric juice derived from 0.4 N NaCl-exposed rats.
 We conclude from our observations that in mild irritant-exposed stomachs, the gastric juice is a main contributor to the protection against ethanol injury.

"Exercise test predictors of ambulatory silent ischemia during daily life in stable angina pectoris.
 The predictive value of several exercise test parameters in identifying stable angina patients at risk of silent myocardial ischemia during daily life were examined.
 A total of 97 patients with coronary artery disease, stable angina and ambulatory electrocardiographic data were evaluated.
 Of the 86 patients with a positive exercise test, 39 (group 1) had greater than or equal to 1 episodes of ST-segment depression and 47 (group 2) did not develop ST changes during ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.
 Comparison of the exercise test parameters between the 2 groups revealed early onset of ischemia during exercise tests as the single most significant (p less than 0.0005) predictor of ambulatory silent ischemia.
 The other exercise test parameters showing significant differences between the 2 groups were the peak exercise heart rate (117 +/- 23 vs 126 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and peak systolic blood pressure (160 +/- 27 vs 176 +/- 27 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), both of which were significantly lower in the group 1 patients.
 These data were used to derive simple mathematical formulas for calculating the risk of ambulatory silent ischemia.
 These results demonstrate that stable angina patients at risk of silent ischemia during daily life can be accurately identified by evaluation of selected exercise test parameters.

"Differences in health status between older and younger homeless adults.
 The Institute of Medicine has placed a priority on determining the special health-care needs of elderly homeless persons.
 As part of a community-based study of 521 homeless adults in two beach communities of Los Angeles, we compared the demographic characteristics and health of older (age rangek 50-78, n = 61) and younger (age range, 18-49, n = 460) homeless individuals.
 Compared with younger adults, older adults were more likely to be white (85% versus 61%), veterans (59% versus 27%), retired (36% versus 3%), and living in a vehicle (21% versus 8%).
 Older adults were more likely to report having a chronic disease (69% versus 49%), functional disabilities, no informal social contacts during the previous month (49% versus 27%), observed high blood pressure (42% versus 22%), elevated creatinine (11% versus 2%), and elevated cholesterol (57% versus 36%).
 Older adults were less likely to have a toothache (3% versus 30%), report psychotic symptoms (25% versus 42%), and to be illegal drug users (15% versus 55%).
 Although they are chronologically younger, the constellation of health and functional problems of older homeless adults resemble those of geriatric persons in the general population.
 We suggest that geriatricians could play a significant role in training other primary-care providers to evaluate and treat socially isolated older homeless adults in a more comprehensive way than is currently standard in practice (e.g., interdisciplinary team care and emphasis on functional status, rehabilitative medicine, and assessment for sensory impairment).

"Evidence for gastric mucosal cell invasion by C. pylori: an ultrastructural study.
 It is now generally accepted that Campylobacter pylori is closely associated with peptic ulcer disease and chronic type B gastritis.
 Whether C.
 pylori is the direct etiologic cause of either or both of these illnesses remains unclear.
 Possible pathophysiologic effects of C.
 pylori are still a matter of debate and conjecture.
 Utilizing a small group of patients with gastric ulcers and chronic gastritis, we examined the ultrastructural relationship between C.
 pylori and gastric cells.
 Forty-eight percent of our gastric ulcer patients and 57% of our chronic gastritis patients had C.
 pylori in their lower corpus mucosa.
 Examination with the transmission electron microscope indicated a very close proximation by C.
 pylori to the surface epithelial cells strongly suggesting adherence.

 These observations may also explain why C.

"Diagnostic testing and return visits for acute problems in prepaid, case-managed Medicaid plans compared with fee-for-service.
 Enrollment of Medicaid recipients into capitated, case-managed systems of health care has been advocated as a means to control costs.
 We studied the effect of such systems on care for urinary tract infection (UTI), pelvic inflammatory disease, and vaginitis among women enrolled in Aid to Families with Dependent Children in capitated demonstration programs in Santa Barbara County, California, and Jackson County, Missouri (prepaid), compared with similar but fee-for-service (FFS) counties in Ventura County, California, and St Louis, Mo.
 Structured abstracts were performed on 2382 outpatient charts with one of the three conditions in 1985.
 The proportion of cases with UTI in which a urine culture was obtained was similar in Santa Barbara (prepaid) and Ventura (FFS), 47% vs 46%, but greater in Jackson County (prepaid) than St Louis (FFS), 58% vs 32%.
 The proportion of cases with return visits for a UTI was: Santa Barbara (prepaid), 40%; Ventura (FFS), 33%; Jackson (prepaid), 72%; and St Louis (FFS), 53%.

"Pharmacology of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as a guide to their use in congestive heart failure.
 The pharmacokinetics of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are difficult to assess for several reasons.
 First, these compounds exert their influence by inhibiting an intermediary enzyme of a cascade of enzymatic events, whose rate-limiting enzyme (renin) is not directly affected by ACE inhibition.
 Second, renin and angiotensin I accumulate during ACE inhibition and a change in the dose of an ACE inhibitor could produce sudden shifts of angiotensin I to angiotensin II.
 Third, components of the circulating renin system require the interaction of several organ systems and effector sites.
 Fourth, the kinetics of ACE inhibitors can be influenced by the organ systems responsible for drug absorption, metabolism and excretion, and the functional status of these systems can be affected by the heart failure process.
 Fifth, at least some portion of the cardiovascular effects of ACE inhibitors is influenced by the contributions of other systems whose physiologic effects may be of importance in some patients with congestive heart failure.
 Sixth, the potential impact of tissue-bound ACE is not yet fully understood.
 Finally, for appropriate drug dosing, the effects of aging on the heart failure process, the extent of renin system activity, and the disposition of ACE inhibitors need to be considered.
 Because of their complex pharmacokinetics, treatment with ACE inhibitors has been guided by their pharmacodynamic and clinical characteristics.

"Prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal bypass for intermittent claudication.
 There is no consensus about the most appropriate management of the patient with intermittent claudication due to a superficial femoral artery occlusion.
 To evaluate the natural history of prosthetic above-knee femoropopliteal (AKFP) bypass, 200 operations for intermittent claudication were reviewed.
 One hundred AKFP bypasses were done with PTFE and 100 with dacron.
 In the 30 day postoperative period, four PTFE and three dacron grafts occluded without consequence and only one patient died.
 Analysis of results by the life-table method demonstrated statistically similar primary graft patency rates at five years (PTFE 65% SE +/- 6.5, dacron 57% +/- 6.2) and ten years (PTFE 31% +/- 18/9, dacron 32% +/- 13.2) (p greater than 0.10).
 Redo procedures (e.g., thrombectomy, angioplasty) were necessary on 21 grafts (12 PTFE, 9 dacron) and ""secondary"" patency rates at five years were 76% PTFE and 62% dacron; no grafts which required a redo procedure were patent at ten year follow-up.
 Major amputations during ten year follow-up were necessary in 16 (8%) patients; all amputations were in diabetic patients.
 Survival rates were 79% at five and 42% at ten years.
 An anticipated, the leading cause of death was cardiac related (25 patients); 28 (14%) patients underwent aortocoronary bypass during follow-up.
 A prosthetic AKFP bypass graft is a safe and durable operation which provides relief from the symptoms of intermittent claudication while allowing for the preservation of the saphenous vein for use later in the coronary or infrapopliteal circulations, should the need arise.
 These results indicate that the risk of amputation after AKFP is no greater than the natural history of untreated claudication; however, AKFP offers a significant improvement in life-style.

"Uremic platelets have a functional defect affecting the interaction of von Willebrand factor with glycoprotein IIb-IIIa.
 Uremic patients have an impaired platelet function that has been related to membrane glycoprotein (GP) abnormalities.
 Using a perfusion system, we have studied the interaction of normal and uremic platelets with vessel subendothelium (SE) under flow conditions.
 Reconstituted blood containing washed platelets, purified von Willebrand factor (vWF) (1 U/mL), and normal washed red blood cells was exposed to de-endothelialized rabbit segments for 10 minutes at two different shear rates (800 and 1,600 seconds-1).
 In some experiments a monoclonal antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex (EDU3) was added to the perfusates.
 With normal platelets, the percentage of the vessel covered by platelets (%CS) was 23.1% +/- 3.7% at 800 seconds-1 and 30% +/- 4.3% at 1,600 seconds-1.
 Platelets were observed in contact or forming monolayers on vessel SE.
 EDU3 inhibited the spreading of normal platelets.
 The %CS (11.1% +/- 3.3%) was statistically decreased (P less than .01) and most of the platelets were observed in contact with the vessel surface.
 These data indicate that, under flow conditions, the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa can support the spreading of normal platelets in the absence of exogenous fibrinogen.
 Under the same experimental conditions, the interaction of uremic platelets with SE was markedly impaired at both shear rates studied (P less than .01 v normal platelets).
 The presence of EDU3 did not modify the interaction of uremic platelets.
 These results confirm the impairment of the platelet adhesion observed in uremic patients.
 Furthermore, they indicate the presence of a functional defect in the interaction of vWF with GPIIb-IIIa.
 The fact that perfusions with normal and uremic platelets in the presence of an antibody to the GPIIb-IIIa complex did not show any differences gives indirect evidence on a functionally normal interaction vWF/GPIb in uremic patients.

"Glucocorticoids inhibit neurogenic plasma extravasation and prevent virus-potentiated extravasation in the rat trachea.
 Capsaicin increases the permeability of blood vessels in the rat tracheal mucosa through a mechanism involving the release of tachykinins from sensory nerves.
 This capsaicin-induced increase in vascular permeability is potentiated by viral infections of the respiratory tract.
 The present study was done to determine whether this ""neurogenic plasma extravasation"" can be inhibited by glucocorticoids, to learn the time course of this inhibition, and to determine whether glucocorticoids can prevent the potentiating effect of viral respiratory infections on neurogenic plasma extravasation.
 Groups of pathogen-free F344 rats were treated with dexamethasone for 2 or 8 h (4 mg/kg i.p.) or 48 or 120 h (0.5-4 mg/kg per d i.p.).
 Another group of rats was treated with dexamethasone for 120 h following the intranasal inoculation of Sendai virus.
 The magnitude of plasma extravasation produced by capsaicin or substance P was assessed after this treatment by using Monastral blue pigment and Evans blue dye as intravascular tracers.
 We found that dexamethasone reduced, in a dose-dependent fashion, the magnitude of plasma extravasation produced in the rat trachea by capsaicin and substance P.
 Significant inhibition was produced by a dose of dexamethasone as small as 0.5 mg/kg i.p.
 The effect of dexamethasone had a latency of several hours and reached a maximum after 2 d of treatment.
 Furthermore, dexamethasone prevented the potentiation of neurogenic plasma extravasation usually present after 5 d of Sendai virus respiratory infection.

 A prospective study of 370 patients who underwent 500 percutaneous transluminal angioplasties (PTAs) for lower-limb ischemia over a 7-year period was performed.
 A 97% follow-up rate was achieved.
 The first PTA was successful in 188 patients (51%).
 Of the failures, 31% were failed attempts at dilation and 73% occurred within 1 month of intervention.
 Of the patients with failed PTA, 39% underwent bypass surgery and 24% underwent amputation.
 The 30-day mortality rate was 3%, with 1% of the deaths attributed to PTA.
 The survival rate at 5 years for the successes was double that for the failures (P less than .0005).
 The best results were in femoropopliteal stenoses with two or three patent calf vessels (cumulative patency rate, 78% at 3 years) and the worst in femoropopliteal occlusions with one or no patent calf vessels (cumulative patency rate, 25% at 3 years).
 Log rank tests on the life-table data were used to show factors favoring a good outcome.
 It is concluded that PTA is the treatment of first choice in suitable patients and, although the failure of intervention in critical ischemia has a significant risk, it is a valuable addition to the therapeutic options in patients with little chance of surgical treatment.

 To assess its construct validity and application, Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) was administered to 267 inpatient substance abusers.
 One hundred seventy-two of the patients were alcoholic, 47 abused stimulants, and 48 abused other drugs, primarily benzodiazepines, marijuana, or were polysubstance abusers.
 Of the sample 33.8% were female.
 Analyses were conducted to (1) determine whether TPQ scores could be used to classify alcoholics as either Cloninger Type I or Type II; (2) examine the intercorrelations of TPQ scales and identify differences in these patterns due to drug of choice; (3) replicate previously obtained gender differences on the TPQ.
 The results indicate that (1) TPQ scores did not classify the alcoholics into the expected frequencies for Type I and Type II; (2) the scales were not independent and did not give rise to any differences among drug user groups, but (3) did confirm previously reported gender differences.
 These results indicate that Cloninger's model and the TPQ must be subjected to careful empirical study prior to their widespread acceptance.

 If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case).
 The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop.
 The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event.

"The effect of abdominal surgery on the serum concentration of the tumour-associated antigen CA 125.
 The CA 125 assay is used to monitor the course of disease in women with adenocarcinoma of the genital tract.
 We measured serum CA 125 levels longitudinally in three different groups of patients who had normal serum CA 125 levels (less than or equal to 16 U/ml) before extensive intraperitoneal abdominal surgery (group 1, second-look laparotomy in 28 women with ovarian cancer; group 2, radical hysterectomy in 42 patients with cervical cancer; group 3, 13 men and one woman who had aortic surgery for atherosclerotic occlusive disease or aneurysm formation).
 Following surgery, rising serum CA 125 levels were observed in 69 out of the 84 patients (82%), irrespective of the primary diagnosis, type of operation or sex.
 The highest levels were found during the second week after the operation (range 3-336 U/ml) and decreased gradually thereafter, to become normal at 8 weeks after surgery.
 It was concluded that abdominal surgery interferes with the specificity of CA 125 as a tumour marker during the early postoperative period.

"Post-traumatic acute renal failure, 1956-1988.
 Eighty patients with acute renal failure secondary to trauma treated between 1956 and 1988 are reviewed.
 The overall mortality was 46.3%.
 Factors associated with increased mortality were age, high Injury Severity Score, and injury to the abdomen and pelvic contents.
 The number of injuries, the delay between injury and the institution of dialysis, and the level of urea on starting dialysis did not affect mortality.
 The declining incidence of traumatic acute renal failure highlights the importance of prompt effective resuscitation of injured patients.

"Left ventricular versus left atrial cannulation for the Thoratec ventricular assist device.
 In a retrospective study of 28 patients (23 men, 5 women) supported with ventricular assist devices greater than 3 days, the effect of LV cannulation versus LA cannulation on device performance was compared.
 Patients ranged in age from 12 to 67 years (mean 46 years) and were supported for 3-81 days (mean 15 years).
 Fifteen patients were supported with left VADs (6 LV and 9 LA), and 13 patients were supported with BVADs (5 LV and 8 LA).
 The mode of operation 91% of the time was the fill-to-empty mode.
 Ten data points were taken for each patient.
 LV cannulation results in higher VAD flow index at decreased preload, lower VAD systolic and vacuum pressures, and shorter diastolic durations.
 Eleven of the 28 patients survived.
 Although survival was greater in patients with LV cannulation, survival was more dependent upon reversibility of myocardial damage, eligibility for transplantation, or the development of complications.
 These data indicate that LV cannulation provides better VAD performance than LA cannulation in the fill-to-empty mode.

"Reduction of postoperative morbidity following patient-controlled morphine 
 The present study examined the impact of two methods of pain management on recovery in 38 women undergoing hysterectomy.
 One group received IV morphine in the recovery room and IM morphine on the ward on a PRN basis (PRN group).
 In the other group, a loading dose of morphine 8 mg IV was given when the patient first complained of pain and patient-controlled IV morphine (PCA) was initiated and continued for 48 h (PCA group).
 Both groups received similar amounts of morphine overall, differently distributed over time.
 The PCA patients received 8 mg.h-1 in the recovery room (approximately 2.5 hrs) and less thereafter.
 The PRN patients received approximately 2 mg.h-1 for the entire 48-hr period.
 Pain control was better throughout convalescence and less variable across time with PCA management.
 Minute ventilation also recovered faster and by day four was 25 per cent above the preoperative baseline in the PCA group.
 In addition, oral temperature became normal one day earlier, ambulation recovered more rapidly and patients were discharged from hospital earlier.
 The data suggest that early treatment with relatively high, self-titrated morphine doses may alter the course of the metabolic response to surgery.

"The acute effects of alcohol on the blood pressure of young, normotensive men.
 Alcohol's acute effects on arterial blood pressure (BP) were examined.
 To separate the effects of alcohol on BP from those of fluid volume and expectancy, normotensive men were divided into three groups.
 The alcohol group received 1.0 ml of absolute alcohol/kg of body weight.
 The expectancy group expected alcohol but received only tonic.
 The control group expected and received only tonic.
 With age as a covariate, significant changes in systolic BP were found only in the alcohol group, indicating that the changes in systolic BP were not attributable to subject expectancy or volume of fluid consumed.
 The expectancy control groups did not differ from each other.
 A significant quadratic trend was found for systolic BP in the alcohol group, suggesting that alcohol may have an acute biphasic effect on systolic BP, with an initial decrease as the alcohol is ingested followed by an increase toward the basal level during detoxication.
 No significant effects were found for diastolic BP.

"Prospective study of the frequency and size distribution of polyps missed by colonoscopy.
 An important determinant in interpreting the results of colorectal polyp chemoprevention trials is the rate of polyps missed during colonscopic examination.
 We prospectively examined 90 patients by tandem colonoscopy performed by two alternating examiners.
 In 69 (76.7%) patients, 221 neoplastic lesions were documented histologically.
 Of a total of 58 lesions detected in 31 patients, no neoplastic lesion greater than or equal to 10 mm in size was missed; 16% of diminutive (less than or equal to 5 mm) neoplastic polyps and 12.3% of medium-sized (6-9 mm) neoplastic polyps were missed by the first examiner.
 We conclude that an experienced colonoscopist will miss about 15% of colorectal neoplastic polyps less than 10 mm in size in the setting of adequate bowel preparation.
 Large (greater than or equal to 10 mm) polyps were rarely missed, however, with the ""miss"" rate in our study equal to 0, with a 95% confidence limit of 4.64%.

"Cold follicles in a multinodular human goiter arise partly from a failing iodide pump and partly from deficient iodine organification.
 To investigate whether the common cold follicles in human multinodular goiters are the consequence of a functional defect of the apical membrane peroxidase, a failure of the iodide transport system, or both deficiencies, we studied iodide accumulation and iodine organification in 30 fragments of a large multinodular goiter transplanted to nude mice and labeled with 125I.
 Transplants were frozen to -80 C immediately after removal to avoid diffusion of inorganic iodide.
 Autoradiographic assessment of over 1000 cryosections (exposed either at -20 C or after thawing and washing out unbound iodide) showed two types of cold follicles, namely those that failed to accumulate iodide and, therefore, did not organify iodine, and those that readily accumulated iodide but failed to bind it, suggesting a failure of apical membrane peroxidase.
 The two types of pathogenetically different cold follicles coexisted in an apparently randomly intermingled fashion throughout the whole goiter.

"Role of small calibre chest tube drainage for iatrogenic pneumothorax.
 A 2 mm Teflon catheter was used as a chest tube in 28 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax.
 Frequent aspirations through the catheter were performed in 16 of the patients.
 In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve.
 The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube.
 The mean drainage time was 48 hours.
 The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome.
 The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique.

"Myelin basic protein-specific T lymphocyte lines from MS patients and healthy individuals.
 We derived a total of 146 T lymphocyte lines specific for human myelin basic protein (MBP) from the peripheral blood of 20 MS patients and from a control group of 12 healthy donors, and determined the reactivities of T cell lines by [3H]thymidine incorporation on exposure to MBP and MBP peptides 1-44, 45-89, and 90-170.
 We defined HLA restriction of the T lines by using monoclonal antibodies against monomorphic determinants on human HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DP molecules.
 MBP-specific T cell lines could be isolated with a comparable efficiency from MS patients and healthy individuals.
 In both groups, MBP-specific T lymphocytes recognized at least 4 different epitopes in the MBP molecule, and specificities showed comparable patterns for different MBP peptides.
 MBP-specific T cell lines derived from MS patients and controls were restricted by DR products of the human major histocompatibility class II locus.
 Notable phenotypic differences of T cell lines existed between the 2 groups.
 Lines isolated from MS patients expressed predominantly the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- phenotype, while some control lines were composed of up to 87% CD3+CD4+CD8+ T lymphocytes.
 These findings illustrate the presence of MBP-specific T cells in MS patients and controls that are similarly sensitized to MBP and restricted by HLA-DR products.

 Of the men 12 (80%) with continually increasing prostate specific antigen levels before treatment had a decrease in prostate specific antigen with a median duration of response of 3 months.
 Three patients (20%) had a prolonged response (greater than or equal to 8 months) as seen by a persistently decreasing prostate specific antigen and improvement in bone pain.
 There appears to be a small subgroup of patients with progressive prostate cancer despite androgen ablation who will benefit from ketoconazole and glucocorticoid treatment.

"Calcium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce preterm delivery in high-risk populations.
 Results are presented of a randomized, double-blinded controlled clinical trial of calcium supplementation (2.0 gm of elemental calcium as calcium carbonate) and a placebo.
 All participants were 17 years of age or less and clinically healthy.
 Patients were enrolled by the twenty third week of gestation.
 The mean duration of calcium supplementation or placebo was approximately 14 weeks.
 Treatment consisted of 2.8 (+/- 1.5) tablets per day in the placebo group (N = 95) and 3.0 (+/- 1.4) tablets per day in the calcium group (N = 94).
 Dietary calcium intake was similar in both groups at about 1200 mg/day.
 The calcium group had a lower incidence of preterm delivery (less than 37 weeks; 7.4% vs 21.1%; p = 0.007); spontaneous labor and preterm delivery (6.4% vs 17.9%; p = 0.01); and low birth weight (9.6% vs 21.1%; p = 0.03).
 This effect was also present after stratified analysis by level of treatment compliance, urinary tract infection, and chlamydial infection.
 Life-table analysis demonstrated an overall shift to a higher gestational age in the calcium group compared with the placebo group (log-rank test, p = 0.02).
 As suggested previously, the observed effect could be mediated by a reduction in uterine smooth muscle contractibility.
 If confirmed by future research, these results could represent an important preventive intervention for prematurity in high-risk populations.

 The Wilms tumor locus on chromosome 11p13 has been mapped to a region defined by overlapping, tumor-specific deletions.
 Complementary DNA clones representing transcripts of 2.5 (WIT-1) and 3.5 kb (WIT-2) mapping to this region were isolated from a kidney complementary DNA library.
 Expression of WIT-1 and WIT-2 was restricted to kidney and spleen.
 RNase protection revealed divergent transcription of WIT-1 and WIT-2, originating from a DNA region of less than 600 bp.
 Both transcripts were present at high concentrations in fetal kidney and at much reduced amounts in 5-year-old and adult kidneys.

"Antimony and glass pH electrodes can be used interchangeably in 24-hour studies of gastric acidity.
 Antimony and glass pH electrodes show almost identical experimental errors in continuously measuring buffer solutions at constant temperature over 24 hr.
 These errors are lower than the nominal quantization error of the instruments and are not properly described by the 24-hr drift determination.
 The addition of food particles to the solutions can induce severe reading artifacts.
 The longer response time reported in vitro of antimony electrodes when moving from pH 1 to pH 7 (3.4 sec vs 0.8 sec with glass electrodes) is irrelevant during in vivo pH-metry studies, because we found that the greatest absolute difference between raw fast acquired (4-6 sec) consecutive pH readings of two commonly used devices was 0.7 pH units in circadian profiles obtained from 413 subjects with various clinical conditions.
 In our in vivo studies, gastric acidity was monitored continuously with two side-by-side minielectrodes, which were variously combined (antimony-glass, A-G; antimony-antimony A1-A2; glass-glass, G1-G2) and applied on groups of 27 subjects matched for clinical condition.
 The 24-hr pH means and the 24-hr [H+] means calculated from the acidity profiles obtained with the three electrode combinations, lie on the identity line in each group.
 Using the Bland-Altman technique for assessing measurement agreement, the differences between the 24-hr pH means and the 24-hr [H+] means obtained with the three combined systems are similar (P = .903 and P = 0.824, respectively) and their 95% confidence limits are comprised within the range (+/-) of the reading error of the measuring systems (namely, +/- 0.3 pH units and +/- 12 mmol/liter in terms of [H+]).

"A randomized, double-blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome 
 BACKGROUND.
 Candida albicans infection has been proposed to cause a chronic hypersensitivity syndrome characterized by fatigue, premenstrual tension, gastrointestinal symptoms, and depression.
 Long-term antifungal therapy has been advocated as treatment for the syndrome, which is most often diagnosed in women with persistent or recurrent candida vaginitis.
 METHODS.
 To determine the efficacy of nystatin therapy for presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, we conducted a 32-week randomized, double-blind, cross-over study using four different combinations of nystatin or placebo given orally or vaginally in 42 premenopausal women who met present criteria for the syndrome and had a history of candida vaginitis.
 The outcomes studied were the changes from base line in scores for vaginal, systemic, and overall symptoms and in the results of standardized psychological tests.
 RESULTS.
 The three active-treatment regimens (oral and vaginal nystatin, oral nystatin and vaginal placebo, and oral placebo and vaginal nystatin) and the all-placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (P less than 0.001), but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo.
 On average, the scores for systemic symptoms improved 25 percent with the three active-treatment regimens and 23 percent with the all-placebo regimen, a difference of only 2 percent (95 percent confidence interval, -3 to 7 percent).
 As expected, the three active-treatment regimens were more effective than placebo in relieving vaginal symptoms (P less than 0.001).
 All four regimens reduced psychological symptoms and global indexes of distress; there were no significant differences among the treatment regimens.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 In women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome, nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo.
 Consequently, the empirical recommendation of long-term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted.

"Myasthenic thymus and thymoma are selectively enriched in acetylcholine receptor-reactive T cells.
 We compared T-cell proliferative responses to acetylcholine receptor (AChR) and to purified protein derivative (PPD) (of tuberculin) of hyperplastic thymus, thymoma, and blood cells from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).
 Hyperplastic MG thymus cells gave significantly higher and more consistent responses to AChR than parallel cultures of autologous blood cells, whereas responses to PPD showed an opposite trend.
 Thus there was a preferential localization of AChR-reactive T cells in the hyperplastic MG thymus.
 Furthermore, there was a strong correlation between blood and thymus cell responses to PPD (but not to AChR), arguing that the hyperplastic MG thymus contains a sample of sensitized peripheral T cells.
 By contrast, both AChR- and PPD-responsive T cells were almost undetectable in thymus from nonmyasthenic patients, which is evidently much less receptive to circulating T cells.
 Cells from MG thymomas showed the highest stimulations by AChR but did not consistently react to PPD.
 However, the uninvolved thymus adjacent to these thymomas behaved almost identically to the hyperplastic samples described above.
 Our interpretation is that AChR-specific T cells are initially sensitized in the MG thymoma but are selectively trapped in the hyperplastic thymus after being primed elsewhere.

"Molecular biology of circulatory shock. Part III. Human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells demonstrate two patterns of shock-induced gene expression that are independent, exclusive, and prioritized.
 During shock and resuscitation, parenchymal cells of solid organs are exposed to a rapidly changing microenvironment, which may include a reduced oxygen tension and an increased concentration of certain cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1.
 In vivo experiments that testedl iver biopsied from pigs undergoing cardiogenic shock and resuscitation demonstrated several patterns of gene expression.
 To study the independent and additive influences of hypoxia and of cytokines in vitro, human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were perturbed by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), by heat shock, and by the cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha alone and in combination.
 H/R induces new patterns of protein synthesis and secretion that are indistinguishable from those induced by heat shock and independent of the acute-phase response mediated by the cytokines.
 The H/R (heat-shock) response has priority over and will extinguish gene expression supported by the cytokines.
 This previously unrecognized hierarchy of stress gene expression could well form the molecular basis of shock-related cell and organ failure.

"The validity and reliability of the navicular fat stripe as a screening test for detection of navicular fractures.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if the navicular fat stripe (NFS) is a valid and reliable screening tool in assessing potential navicular fractures.
 DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
 SETTING: Minor trauma section of the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center emergency department.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Study population included patients seen for wrist injury between January 1987 and December 1988.
 The individuals who interpreted the radiographs included eight observers with varying degrees of radiographic experience.
 INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The positive predictive value averaged 12% or 15% depending on how we counted a straight NFS, and the negative predictive value averaged 93% or 95%, again depending on how we counted a straight NFS.
 A straight NFS was ten times as likely to occur among normal wrists than among those with navicular fractures.
 Interobserver reliability was found to be high with a Hoyt reliability coefficient of .79.
 CONCLUSIONS: An abnormal NFS is a poor predictor of a navicular fracture while both a straight and a normal NFS are good predictors of no navicular fracture.
 A normal NFS may allow less stringent treatment by the emergency physician.
 Extremes of radiographic experience were found to have no significant effect on NFS interpretation.

"Hyponatremia in rats induces downregulation of vasopressin synthesis.
 Hyponatremia due to inappropriate secretion of vasopressin is a common disorder in human pathophysiology, but vasopressin synthesis during hypoosmolality has not been investigated.
 We used a new method to quantitate synthesis of vasopressin in rats after 3, 7, and 14 d of hyponatremia induced by administering dDAVP (a vasopressin agonist) and a liquid diet.
 Vasopressin synthesis was completely turned off by 7 d.
 Vasopressin mRNA levels in the hypothalamus paralleled the reduction in synthesis and were reduced to levels of only 10-15% of the content in control rats.
 When hyponatremia was corrected by withdrawal of dDAVP, vasopressin mRNA slowly returned to normal over 7 d.
 The observation that vasopressin synthesis can be so completely turned off leads to several conclusions: under normal physiological conditions the neurohypophysis is chronically upregulated; there must be an osmotic threshold for initiation of vasopressin synthesis (and release); the large store of hormone in the posterior pituitary is essential for vasopressin to be available during times of decreased synthesis; and, finally, some nonosmolar stimulus for synthesis must be present during clinical disorders when vasopressin is secreted (and synthesized) despite hypoosmolality.

"Direct interaction of a ligand for the erbB2 oncogene product with the EGF receptor and p185erbB2.
 The erbB2 oncogene encodes a 185-kilodalton transmembrane protein whose sequence is similar to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
 A 30-kilodalton factor (gp30) secreted from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was shown to be a ligand for p185erbB2.
 An antibody to EGFR abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) but only partially blocked that produced by gp30 in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells.
 In two cell lines that overexpress erbB2 but do not expresss EGFR (MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that had been transfected with erbB2), phosphorylation of p185erbB2 was induced only by gp30.
 The gp30 specifically inhibited the growth of cells that overexpressed p185erbB2.
 An antibody to EGFR had no effect on the inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell colony formation obtained with gp30.
 Thus, it appeared that gp30 interacted directly with the EGFR and erbB2.
 Direct binding of gp30 to p185erbB2 was confirmed by binding competition experiments, where gp30 was found to displace the p185erbB2 binding of a specific antibody to p185erbB2.
 The evidence described here suggests that gp30 is a ligand for p185erbB2.

 A clinical trial of chronic intermittent vagal stimulation in five patients suggests that the procedure may be safe and effective as adjunctive treatment of medically intractable seizures of partial onset.
 Patients tolerated well the implantation of the neurocybernetic prosthesis and the vagal stimulation without serious physiological or lifestyle changes.
 Stimulation of the vagus nerve either reduced the seizure frequency or decreased the duration or intensity of seizures.
 Adverse side effects were limited to a tingling sensation in the throat and hoarseness during stimulation.
 A major complication was mechanical interruption of the wire-electrode circuitry, with consequent cessation of stimulation.
 The small number of patients and the relatively short follow-up period make this a pilot study, but the results are promising.

 Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides.

"Association of vertebral end plate fracture with pediatric lumbar intervertebral disk herniation: value of CT and MR imaging.
 A retrospective review of the radiologic findings in 31 patients less than 21 years old who underwent laminotomy for lumbar disk herniation revealed six cases of associated avulsion fracture of the vertebral end plate, a prevalence of 19%.
 All fractures were found in the 14-17-year-old subgroup (six of 19), a prevalence of 32%.
 In four patients, plain radiographs did not reveal the fracture.
 Computed tomographic (CT) findings were diagnostic in all six cases.
 Magnetic resonance (MR) images, obtained in three patients, demonstrated the avulsed cortical fragment and what are assumed to be the attached Sharpey fibers.
 On sagittal MR images, these structures had a configuration with the appearance of a ""Y"" or ""7"".
 Four of these six patients underwent bilateral laminotomies.
 The need for more extensive surgical resection may not be apparent at plain radiography or myelography but can be predicted with CT and MR imaging.

"Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by primary ventricular fibrillation. Principal Investigators of the SPRINT Study.
 In 5,839 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hospitalized between July 1981 and July 1983 in 14 coronary care units in Israel, the incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 2.1%.
 Patients with primary VF resembled counterparts without VF in terms of age, gender, frequency of previous AMI and past cigarette smoking habits.
 The hospital course of patients with primary VF revealed increased incidence of primary atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block.
 Increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were noted among the patients with primary VF.
 In-hospital mortality rate was 18.8% in 122 patients with primary VF compared with 8.5% in 3,707 patients forming the reference group (p less than 0.01).
 Adjustment by age using logistic function yielded an estimate of 2.86 for relative mortality odds associated with primary VF, and further adjustment by gender, history of AMI, systemic hypertension, and by enzymatically estimated infarct size slightly reduced the estimated odds, at 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 4.46).
 Prognosis after discharge from the hospital was independent of primary VF.
 In conclusion, primary VF exerts an independent, significant effect on in-hospital mortality.

"Haplotype analysis of the human apolipoprotein B mutation associated with familial defective apolipoprotein B100.
 Haplotype analysis was conducted on the mutant allele of 14 unrelated subjects heterozygous for a mutation in the codon for amino acid 3500 of human apolipoprotein B100.
 This mutation is associated with defective binding of low-density lipoprotein to the low-density lipoprotein receptor and with moderate hypercholesterolemia.
 Ten markers were used for haplotyping: eight diallelic markers within the structural gene and two hypervariable loci flanking the gene.
 Seven of eight unequivocally deduced haplotypes were identical, and one revealed only a minor difference at one of the hypervariable loci.
 The genotypes of the six other affected subjects were consistent with this same assigned haplotype.
 These data are consistent with a common ancestral chromosome and provide no evidence for a recurrent mutation at this potentially hypermutable CG dinucleotide, despite the fact that this mutation is not rare.

"Children riding in the back of pickup trucks: a neglected safety issue.
 Motor vehicle-related trauma is the leading cause of death in children in the United States.
 All states have pediatric restraint requirements for passenger vehicles to help prevent these deaths and injuries.
 Only a few states, however, possess safety laws or restrictions for passengers who ride in the back of pickup trucks.
 A retrospective review of medical records for a 40-month period revealed 40 patients whose injuries were a direct result of being a passenger in the cargo area (bed) of a pickup truck.
 Their injuries and other pertinent data are discussed.
 Representatives from the Highway Safety Commission of each state were surveyed about their specific highway safety laws.
 The responses revealed that all states and the District of Columbia have child restraint requirements for passenger automobiles, 34 states have adult restraint laws, but only 17 states have any type of restriction for passengers riding in the back of pickup trucks.
 Seventy-one percent of the states with pickup truck regulations include only the preschool-age child.

"Surgery in patients on long-term steroid therapy: a tentative model for risk assessment.
 Increased morbidity after operation has been associated with long-term steroid therapy.
 To determine the correlation between steroid therapy and such morbidity, the perioperative course of 55 steroid-treated patients was reviewed: 27 had bronchopulmonary disorders (group P) and 28 had non-pulmonary diseases (group NP).
 There were six (11 per cent) deaths, of which three were steroid related.
 Among the 13 non-lethal postoperative complications, eight were considered to be steroid related in group P and one in group NP.
 The duration of steroid therapy was for a median of 24 months (range 1-408 months) in group P and for a median of 6 months (range 1-240 months) in group NP (P less than 0.01).
 In contrast, the daily dose of hydrocortisone or equivalent before operation was significantly lower in group P, with a median of 0.51 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.20-2.56 mg kg-1 day-1) than in group NP, with a median of 1.20 mg kg-1 day-1 (range 0.23-7.38 mg kg-1 day-1) (P less than 0.01).
 In conclusion, bronchopulmonary disorders requiring a long duration of steroid therapy are associated with a higher risk of steroid-related complications after surgery.
 A convenient mathematical model is proposed which may allow a preoperative assessment of surgical risk, using steroid dose and duration of treatment.

"Long-term effect of dopaminergic drugs in restless legs. A 2-year follow-up.
 Thirty patients with restless legs syndrome, who initially had all responded well to treatment with levodopa and benserazide, were studied as to the long-term effect of the drugs (at least 2 years).
 During the 2-year period, two patients were switched from levodopa to bromocriptine.
 Two patients no longer needed levodopa; one of them had developed paraplegia and in the other the symptoms of restless legs syndrome had disappeared completely.
 The remaining 26 patients continued to use levodopa.
 Eight patients maintained the original dose, nine had to use an increased dose, and nine found a decreased dose to be sufficient.
 The only side effect was transient nausea reported by two of the 30 patients.
 The study showed that the relief of symptoms of restless legs syndrome by dopaminergic drugs does not wear off with the passage of time, that side effects are minimal even with long-term use, and that the dose needed to obtain relief may increase as well as decrease.

"Nephrotoxicity associated with concomitant ACE inhibitor and NSAID therapy.
 Angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be nephrotoxic and may synergistically compromise renal function.
 A computer-assisted study was done to asses the prevalence of compromised renal function and the clinical importance of this drug interaction.
 A search of the records of all patients seen in the University of Nebraska Medical Center Internal Medicine Clinic was conducted to identify cases involving renal insufficiency, therapy with ACE inhibitors, or therapy with NSAIDs.
 Records of cases meeting these criteria were reviewed for clinical correlation and revealed 2278 patients treated with NSAIDs, 328 with ACE inhibitors, and 162 with both.
 No nephrotoxicity was found in conjunction with monotherapy, but three cases of reversible renal failure were found in conjunction with combination therapy.
 Significant nephrotoxicity during the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs is not uncommon, and attention should be drawn to this potentially important interaction.

"Intraoral-extramaxillary sinus approach for ligation of the maxillary artery: an anatomic study with clinical correlates.
 Surgical control of severe epistaxis is usually reserved for cases refractory to more conservative techniques.
 We present our experience with intraoral ligation of the maxillary artery as it courses through the buccal fat pad before it enters the pterygopalatine fossa and branches posterior to the maxilla.
 This technique has been found useful in the control of nasal hemorrhage as well as an adjunct to other surgical procedures, such as removal of benign and malignant neoplasms involving the maxilla and paranasal sinuses.
 This technique was used for ligation of the maxillary artery in 20 patients.
 The artery was readily identified in some cases, but required more extensive dissection in others; therefore, an anatomic study in 18 preserved and fresh cadaver specimens was undertaken to investigate the variability of the maxillary artery in the region of the buccal fat pad.
 There appeared to be significant variation in the distance from the buccal mucosal incision site, as well as variation in the relationship to the pterygoid muscles.
 This relationship to the pterygoids explains the occasional difficulty in locating the artery for ligation.
 This technique represents a reasonable alternative to the more traditional transantral approach to ligation of the maxillary artery, as long as the surgeon understands the anatomy of the region, its variations, and where the artery may be located if not immediately apparent.
 No major complications have been experienced.

"The urethral plug: a new treatment modality for genuine urinary stress incontinence in women.
 A new modality, the urethral plug, was used to treat 22 women with genuine urinary stress incontinence.
 The plug is made of thermoplastic elastomer (Kraton G), and consists of a meatal plate, a soft stalk and 1 or 2 spheres along the stalk.
 The spheres were located according to the result of the urethral pressure profile.
 The midpoint of the proximal sphere was placed at the bladder neck and the distal sphere was placed just above the maximum urethral pressure point.
 At voiding the plug was removed and afterwards a new plug was inserted.
 The plug with 2 spheres was tested in week 1 (period 1) and the plug with only the distal sphere was tested in week 2 (period 2).
 A total of 22 patients completed period 1.
 Eight patients did not complete period 2, mostly due to either unchanged incontinence during period 1 or a repeated loss of the plug with 1 sphere.
 In periods 1 and 2, 73 and 79% of the patients were subjectively and objectively continent or improved.
 A total of 14 patients completed both periods.
 Eight patients preferred the plug with 2 spheres, 1 preferred the other plug and 5 had no preference.
 The side effects were few.
 This preliminary study shows that the urethral plug seems to be a promising alternative treatment for female genuine urinary stress incontinence.

 Experience and judgment are important in the successful management of the individual patient with intrahepatic or extrahepatic stones.
 Knowledge of the nonsurgical methods of stone removal is important in the decision-making process.
 However, the biliary surgeon must resist the temptation to do less than a thorough removal of all stones at the operation lest the patient be subjected to additional procedures, which carry their own risks of morbidity and death.
 The goal should be to clear the stones from the biliary system with the fewest procedures offering the lowest morbidity and mortality risks to the patient.

"Inpatient treatment of employed alcoholics: a randomized clinical trial on Hazelden-type and traditional treatment.
 The first randomized clinical trial on the Hazelden-type of treatment showed that this AA-oriented treatment for alcoholism can result in significant improvement in drinking behavior as compared to a more traditional form of treatment.
 One hundred forty-one employed alcoholics were randomized to either Hazelden-type treatment (N = 74) or to traditional-type treatment (N = 67).
 The treatment groups were highly comparable.
 The bimonthly follow-up lasted one year.
 According to the COPES-questionnaire (short form), the treatment at the Hazelden-type institute was significantly more involving, supportive, encouraging to spontaneity and oriented to personal problems than at the traditional-type institute.
 In accordance the treatment drop-out rate was 7.9% at Hazelden-type institute and 25.9% at traditional-type institute (p less than 0.02).
 The participation in outpatient treatment was significantly better after the Hazelden-type treatment.
 The proportion of those abstinent (admitted ethanol consumption, 0 g/day; gammaglutamyl transferase, and mean cell volume were normal) was higher at Hazelden-type institute during the last (8-12 months) follow-up period (26.3% vs.
 9.8%, p = 0.05).
 Fourteen percent of the Hazeldon-type institute patients and 1.9% of the traditional-type institute patients stayed abstinent during the whole 1-year follow-up period (p less than 0.05).
 The differences for the corresponding rates for controlled drinking (admitted ethanol consumption less than 40 g/day, GGT, and MCV normal) were in the same direction but did not reach statistical significance.
 Thus the Hazelden-type treatment obtained better results in 1-year abstinence rate than a more traditional-type treatment.

"Induction of donor-type chimerism in murine recipients of bone marrow allografts by different radiation regimens currently used in treatment of leukemia patients.
 Three radiation protocols currently used in treatment of leukemia patients before bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were investigated in a murine model (C57BL/6----C3H/HeJ) for BM allograft rejection.
 These include (a) a single dose of total body irradiation (8.5 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.2 Gy/min), (b) fractionated TBI (12 Gy administered in six fractions, 2 Gy twice a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, and (c) hyperfractionated TBI (14.4 Gy administered in 12 fractions, 1.2 Gy three times a day in 3 days, delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min).
 Donor-type chimerism 6 to 8 weeks after BMT and hematologic reconstitution on day 12 after BMT found in these groups were compared with results obtained in mice conditioned with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.67 Gy/min, routinely used in this murine model.
 The results in both parameters showed a marked advantage for the single dose 8.5 Gy TBI over all the other treatments.
 This advantage was found to be equivalent to three- to fourfold increment in the BM inoculum when compared with hyperfractionated radiation, which afforded the least favorable conditions for development of donor-type chimerism.
 The fractionated radiation protocol was equivalent in its efficacy to results obtained in mice irradiated by single-dose 8 Gy TBI, both of which afforded a smaller but not significant advantage over the hyperfractionated protocol.
 This model was also used to test the effect of radiation dose rate on the development of donor-type chimerism.
 A significant enhancement was found after an increase in dose rate from 0.1 to 0.7 Gy/min.
 Further enhancement could be achieved when the dose rate was increased to 1.3 Gy/min, but survival at this high dose rate was reduced.
 These results demonstrated indirectly that dose rate affects the expression of host-type pluripotent stem cells, the progeny of which appear 3 to 6 weeks after treatment with 8 Gy TBI delivered at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/min, but which are eradicated if radiation is delivered at a dose rate of 1.3 Gy/min.

"Mitral valve replacement in the first year of life.
 From 1973 through 1987 25 patients underwent mitral valve replacement in the first year of life for mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation.
 The patients with mitral stenosis included two with mitral arcade, two with supravalvular mitral stenosis with hypoplastic mitral valve, and one with parachute mitral valve.
 Included in the group of patients with mitral regurgitation were 12 with atrioventricular canal defect, six with chordal and leaflet defects, one with Marfan's syndrome, and one with bacterial endocarditis.
 Prostheses included 12 Bjork-Shiley (17 mm), seven St.
 Jude Medical (19 mm in four, 21 mm in three), five stent-mounted dura mater valves (12 mm to 16 mm), and one porcine xenograft (19 mm).
 In four patients the valves were placed in the left atrium in a supraannular location.
 There were nine operative (atrioventricular canal defect seven, mitral regurgitation two) and five late (atrioventricular canal defect four, mitral stenosis one) deaths, giving actuarial 1- and 5-year survival rates of 52% and 43%, respectively.
 All 6 patients with tissue valves died; the four with supraannular mitral valve replacement survived.
 Since 1983 operative mortality has been reduced to 0% (70% confidence limits 0% to 24%).
 Nine patients required a second mitral valve replacement for prosthetic stenosis 5 to 69 (mean 30) months after the original mitral valve replacement (one operative death).
 Because of improvements in repair of atrioventricular canal defect in infancy, the need for mitral valve replacement at atrioventricular canal defect repair has decreased.
 Although valvuloplasty has been advocated for repair of congenital mitral valve disease and is applicable in some infants with mitral regurgitation, mitral valve replacement is frequently unavoidable for congenital mitral disease and can now be accomplished at a low operative risk, even when the prosthesis has to be positioned supraannularly.

 Gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 2% of all adult hospital admissions each year.
 Angiodysplasia is one of the most frequently reported causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding.
 In 80% of patients with bleeding angiodysplasia, the bleeding will stop spontaneously, but will often recur.
 Although angiography may detect bleeding in 86% of actively bleeding patients, the bleeding rate must be at least 0.5 mL/min.
 The treatment of choice for control of bleeding has been resection of the suspected segment of bowel, but this procedure is associated with a 10% rebleeding rate and 7% to 8% mortality.
 Superselective catheterization with infusion of vasoconstrictors has been used to control bleeding, but effects are short-lived.
 Superselective embolization occludes an offending vessel, but is difficult to perform accurately and is associated with risk of infarction.

 The risk should be placed in perspective by comparing it with other occupational hazards.
 The risk of seroconversion from a needlestick injury can be calculated from the probability of a needlestick occurrence, the probability that the source patient is infected, and the probability of seroconversion, given an exposure.
 The risk of seroconversion due to drawing 1000 blood specimens from seropositive patients is between 86 and 470 in 100,000.

"Geriatric injury: an analysis of prehospital demographics, mechanisms, and patterns.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate emergency medical services (EMS) system use, injury mechanisms, and prehospital assessments among elderly victims of trauma.
 DESIGN: We analyzed all prehospital data for injuries among patients 70 years old or older for whom 911 EMS dispatch was requested in a medium-sized metropolitan area during a 12-month period.
 RESULTS: A total of 1,154 cases occurred (women, 65.1%), which represented 30.3% of all 911 dispatches involving elderly patients.
 Injury mechanisms were fall (60.7%), motor vehicle accident (MVA; 21.5%), fight (2.4%), accidental poisoning (2.3%), and choking (2.1%).
 Persons in their 90s had a lower frequency of MVAs (3.4%) than did younger patients (23.0%) (P less than .005).
 The most frequent injuries determined by prehospital assessment were head or face (25.1%), upper extremity (17.2%), hip (14.5%), lower extremity (13.8%), back (9.8%), and chest or abdomen (5.0%).
 The frequency of serious neurologic injuries was less for falls or MVAs than for other mechanisms (P less than .005).
 Suspected hip (P less than .001) and pelvic (P less than .005) injuries occurred more frequently during falls than during other mechanisms of injury, whereas back injuries occurred most frequently in MVAs (P less than .001).

 Two regions of the abdomen were designated, the upper and the lower, to further examine the capabilities of CT and LAG in the lower abdomen and CT in the upper abdomen.
 A LAG was more sensitive (P less than 0.05) than CT in detecting positive lower abdominal nodes.
 In the upper abdomen, CT scan had low sensitivity for detecting positive nodes, liver, or spleen.
 This study suggests that LAG of the lower abdomen provided more information than CT, and therefore should not be abandoned as a valid method for detecting nodal disease.

"Assessment of ventricular septal defect closure by intraoperative epicardial ultrasound.
 Intraoperative epicardial two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, color flow mapping and contrast echocardiography were used in 31 patients after patch closure of a ventricular septal defect to determine their respective values in the assessment of residual shunting after cardiopulmonary bypass and for the prediction of long-term results.
 Epicardial imaging showed no incidence of patch dehiscence.
 Residual shunting detected by color flow mapping or contrast echocardiography was graded into one of four categories (0 to III).
 Real time analysis of color flow mapping studies suggested no shunting (grade 0) in 2 patients, grade I shunting in 20, grade II in 8 and grade III in 1; contrast studies suggested grade 0 in 15, grade I in 6, grade II in 8 and grade III in 2.
 Interobserver variation in real time encoding of grade I or II shunting was 25% by color flow mapping and 6% by contrast echocardiography.
 Subsequent frame by frame analysis revealed that both diastolic and early systolic right ventricular turbulence gave rise to false positive results during real time analysis of color flow mapping studies.
 Color flow mapping allowed exact localization of residual shunting, whereas contrast echocardiography allowed better semiquantification.
 Postbypass results were correlated in 30 patients with late postoperative precordial studies (mean interval 7.5 months).
 Persistent shunts were found in 6 (20%) of 30 patients.
 No patient required reoperation for residual shunting.
 The predictive value of immediate grade I or II shunting as a marker for persistent long-term shunting was poor, whereas both patients with immediate grade III shunting had shunt persistence, indicating that immediate revision should be considered in such patients.
 Intraoperative epicardial ultrasound is valuable for the immediate exclusion of important residual shunting after ventricular septal defect closure.
 Maximal information is obtained when color flow mapping and contrast echocardiography are used in combination.

"A constitutive antibody in normal human serum directed against rabbit bone marrow cells: lack in parturients, neonates, and hematologic disorders.
 Normal human serum effectively inhibits a bioassay for erythropoietin based on DNA synthesis by rabbit erythroid precursors.
 This heat-sensitive inhibitory activity is readily lost on dilution of serum, revealing the presence of erythropoietin-potentiating activity.
 Inhibitory activity is caused by a rapid cytotoxic effect on rabbit bone marrow cells; mouse cells are less sensitive.
 Cytotoxic activity is removed from serum by adsorption to protein A, is not expressed at 4 degrees C, and is neutralized by anti-C3c complement antibody.
 Cytotoxicity is inhibited by EGTA; the effect of EGTA is reversed by addition of Ca2+ ions.
 These findings show that cytotoxicity is exerted through an antibody via the classical pathway of complement-dependent cell lysis.
 Although serum from healthy, adult human donors consistently contains cytotoxic activity, no such activity is observed in most serum samples from neonates, parturients, and patients with severe anemia.
 Patients with polycythemia or chronic renal failure occasionally lack cytotoxic activity in their serum.
 Serum samples lacking cytotoxic activity were found to be deficient in the antibody component in 34 out of 35 cases examined.
 These results show that an antibody directed against rabbit cells is constitutively present in normal human serum but is absent in a number of pathologic situations as well as being absent in neonates and parturients.

"Sterol-dependence of gastric protective activity of unsaturated phospholipids.
 The major aim of this study was to investigate the gastric protective effect of unsaturated phospholipids and to determine the ability of neutral lipids to enhance this activity.
 We found that although a liposomal suspension of unsaturated phosphatidylcholine (PC) administered intragastrically failed to protect rats from acid-induced gastric ulcer formation, addition of cholesterol to unsaturated PC induced a dose-dependent protective response with the maximally effective dose, reducing lesion score greater than 70%.
 This effect also was seen with the plant sterol, beta-sitosterol (reducing lesion score by 81.6 +/- 36%) but was blocked if cholesterol was esterified to fatty acids of varying chain length.
 Addition of sterols to liposomes of saturated dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, in contrast, attenuated the gastric protective action of the saturated PC.
 It appears that the protective mechanism elicited by sterols and unsaturated PC is not mediated by alterations in gastric emptying rate or prostaglandin biosynthesis, although maintenance of surface hydrophobicity may be involved.
 These results suggest that the sterol may promote the packing of adjacent unsaturated phospholipid molecules of either the cell membrane or a putative extracellular hydrophobic lining of the gastric epithelium to provide the mucosa with protection against luminal acid.

"Hemopump support for the failing heart.
 Under fluoroscopy, the hemopump is passed through the aortic valve into the left ventricle through a Gortex (WF Gore, Denver, CO) chimney sewn to a surgically exposed femoral artery.
 The system aspirates the left ventricular blood and actively pumps it into the aorta.
 Five patients (four men, one woman), aged 47-71 years (mean, 62 years), were candidates for hemopump support because of refractory cardiogenic shock.
 Three were recovering from repeated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and two required postoperative emergency CABG for failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
 One patient died during insertion, and four had the hemo-pump successfully placed.
 All patients had low cardiac out-put and had intraaortic balloons in place.
 Average insertion time took 20 min, with maintenance on the hemopump for an average of 13 hr.
 One patient was maintained on the hemopump for 12 hr, but because of continued deterioration, was placed on a total artificial heart (Harvik 7-70).
 Patients 3 (hemopump inserted transthoracically) and 4 had the hemopump discontinued because of brain death, and the fifth survived.
 This patient is alive and working 1 yr later.
 The hemopump is an effective left ventricular support system that is less invasive than conventional transthoracic systems.

"Effect of indecainide in patients with left ventricular dysfunction.
 Indecainide, a new antiarrhythmic agent classified as type Ic was evaluated in 11 patients with heart disease who had greater than or equal to 30 ventricular premature complexes/hour, moderate-to-marked left ventricular dysfunction, and mean ejection fraction 34% +/- 8%.
 Patients received indecainide, 50 mg by mouth, every 6 hours and the dose was increased until greater than or equal to 80% suppression was noted, adverse effects occurred, or a maximum dose of 100 mg indecainide was given every 6 hours.
 Ventricular premature complexes were suppressed greater than or equal to 80% in nine patients (p less than 0.05) and ventricular tachycardia episodes were completely suppressed in five of eight patients.
 The effective or maximal mean daily indecainide dose was 191 +/- 32 mg; half of the responders achieved achieved efficacy at serum drug concentration greater than or equal to 600 ng/ml.
 Serum drug concentration was directly related to gender (r = 0.78, p less than 0.04) and inversely related to creatinine clearance (r = 0.74, p less than 0.05) and ejection fraction (r = 0.71, p less than 0.02).
 Indecainide prolonged mean PR and QRS intervals (p less than 0.05) but not QT or QTc.
 There was a linear relation between percent change in PR (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001) and QRS (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) intervals and serum drug concentration.
 After starting or increasing the dose, careful observation of patients with decreased renal function or reduced ejection fraction should be exercised because they attain higher drug concentration than normal subjects.

"A comparison of coarctation resection and subclavian flap angioplasty using ultrasonographically monitored postocclusive reactive hyperemia 
 The reported relatively high incidence of early restenosis at the coarctation repair site with subclavian flap angioplasty, especially in infants less than 3 months of age, prompted a physiologically oriented analysis of relief of obstruction from coarctation after subclavian flap angioplasty versus resection and end-to-end anastomosis in infancy.
 Twenty-one patients who had undergone repair of coarctation in infancy by either subclavian flap angioplasty (nine patients) (median age 8 years) or resection and end-to-end anastomosis (12 patients) (median age 8 years) were evaluated by Doppler spectrum analysis of the blood flow velocities in the femoral artery at rest and during reactive hyperemia.
 The median resting right upper to lower limb systolic pressure difference (with interquartile range) was similar in the angioplasty, resection and anastomosis, and control groups: -5 mm Hg (18 mm Hg), 0 mm Hg (12 mm Hg), and -2.5 mm Hg (10 mm Hg), respectively.
 Also, similar resting values for the maximum frequency of the advancing curve and the pulsatility and resistance indices were measured in the three groups.
 During reactive hyperemia of the leg, however, a significant hemodynamic obstruction across the repair site became clinically manifest in the angioplasty group only, as documented by a lower pulsatility index in comparison with the control group (p = 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test).
 Comparison of the hemodynamic results between the angioplasty and resection and anastomosis groups in subdivisions of infants operated on at an age of less or greater than 3 months, both at rest and during reactive hyperemia, showed, already at rest, a significantly lower value for the pulsatility index in the former angioplasty subdivision (p = 0.05, Student's t test), indicating a significant resistance at the coarctation repair site in the angioplasty patients operated on before the third month of life.
 A disadvantage of angioplasty (compared with resection and anastomosis) was noted when angioplasty was performed before the third month of life, and an unequivocal lack of advantage was noted when performed beyond that period regarding relief of obstruction from coarctation.
 In addition, a definite potential for adverse long-term effects on the hemodynamics of the left upper limb after subclavian flap angioplasty in infancy has been documented.
 For these reasons we prefer to perform resection and end-to-end anastomosis for repair of coarctation in infancy.

 Twenty-five patients were found to have tardive dyskinesia, which was associated with a greater degree of cognitive impairment and negative symptoms.
 This finding was not related to obvious macroscopic organic pathologies, which were less prevalent in the dyskinetic patients.
 In fact, patients with frontal lesions (primarily lobotomies) had a significantly lower prevalence of tardive dyskinesia.

"Neurological phenomena during emergence from enflurane or isoflurane anaesthesia.
 During emergence from anaesthesia, transient neurological signs that would usually be considered pathological may appear.
 The objective of this randomized, patient (n = 30) and observer-blinded study was to compare prospectively the incidence and duration of post-anaesthetic neurological abnormalities in healthy patients undergoing minor elective procedures following thiopentone and succinylcholine induction, and enflurane-N2O or isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia.
 Patients were studied for 60 min after anaesthesia.
 Arousal state, muscle tone, deep tendon reflexes, plantar reflex, sustained clonus, shivering, intense muscular spasticity and temperature were assessed.
 Results of neurological examination were correlated with the patient's state of arousal.
 Transient emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more frequently following enflurane-N2O anaesthesia than isoflurane N2O anaesthesia.
 This was statistically significant (P less than 0.05) for quadriceps hyperreflexia, upgoing toes (positive Babinski reflex) and intense muscular spasticity.
 Neurological abnormalities occurred most commonly 5-20 min after anaesthesia and all abnormalities resolved within 60 min.
 Following enflurane anaesthesia, as patients became more alert the incidence of abnormalities declined, while the arousal state did not affect the incidence of abnormalities after isoflurane.
 There was no significant difference between axillary temperatures of those patients who shivered and those who did not.
 In conclusion, temporary emergent neurological abnormalities occurred more often following enflurane-N2O than after isoflurane-N2O anaesthesia.

"Electrocorticographic confirmation of focal positron emission tomographic abnormalities in children with intractable epilepsy.
 The relationship between focal disturbances of glucose utilization demonstrated by positron emission tomography (PET) and electrophysiologic abnormalities defined by intraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) was studied in eight children (aged 13 months to 12 years) who underwent cortical resection because of intractable seizures.
 None of the children had pure temporal lobe epilepsy.
 Computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were normal in four of the eight children.
 The scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) showed lateralized interictal epileptiform abnormalities in all eight and lateralized ictal onset in five of eight.
 In seven children, interictal PET showed focal hypometabolism; the eighth child had focal, ictal hypermetabolism.
 ECoG at the time of surgery showed epileptiform spiking, slowing, and/or suppression of normal background activity that in every case corresponded to the focus on PET scan.
 The ECoG findings support the notion that in children with epilepsy focal metabolic abnormalities on PET correspond to electrophysiologically abnormal areas of cortex, which are presumably also the epileptogenic regions.
 Such areas can appear normal on anatomic imaging studies (CT and MRI).
 When ictal scalp EEG data are ambiguous or contradictory, PET provides a less invasive means than chronic grid or depth electrode recording for evaluating whether a localized epileptogenic area exists.

 The reactivities of this antibody with various human glioma tissues and cultured glioma cells and the characterization of the antigen recognized by CLN-IgG on malignant glioma cells were analyzed and reported.
 CLN-IgG reacted with various human glioma cells and glioma tissues, especially glioblastoma, but did not react with normal brain tissues or fetal brain tissues.
 A large amount of antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was expressed on cell membranes of undifferentiated glioma cells and of glioma cells at the G2/M tumor growth phase in cycling cells.
 Antigen recognized by CLN-IgG was detected in only one of seven samples of cyst fluid, and was not detected in 27 serum samples or 18 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from glioma patients.
 CLN-IgG exhibited antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity against U-25 1 MG glioma cells and primary cultured cells of glioblastomas and anaplastic astrocytomas.

 Maximal effects on plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were achieved after 4 weeks, and remained stable thereafter during the study.
 Mean fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 280.5 +/- 60.2 mg% to 190.2 +/- 40.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.005) (-47%); mean plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations also decreased from 257.6 +/- 13.4 mg% to 190.5 +/- 15.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.001) (-35%).
 Apolipoprotein A and B concentrations decreased significantly from 1.78 +/- 0.19 to 1.40 +/- 0.22 g/L (p less than .005) and 1.81 +/- 0.26 to 1.38 +/- 0.20 g/L (p less than .005).
 These data substantiate the view that Simvastatin is well tolerated and that no serious clinical or adverse laboratory effects have been observed.

"Pressure effects on roller pump blood flow during hemodialysis.
 Accurate measurement of blood flow during hemodialysis is essential to avoid underdialysis.
 When blood roller pumps are pushed to the high-flow rates demanded by high performance dialyzers, flow may be overestimated.
 This study examined the effect of inflow (Pa) and outflow (Pv) pressures induced by hemodialysis roller pumps on flow in vitro and in vivo.
 Blood flow was measured volumetrically, and with an ultrasonic flow probe, whereas Pa was adjusted from -50 to -400 torr and Pv from 50 to 300 torr.
 Only Pa influenced flow.
 At -200 torr, true flow measured volumetrically averaged 8.5% +/- 1.3% less than the blood pump revolutions per minute (RPM) meter reading.
 At -400 torr, the difference was 33.0% +/- 1.9%.
 There was no visible indication that flow was reduced to less than pump meter readings.
 Pv, hematocrit, and the source of pump tubing had no significant effect.
 Flow measured with an ultrasonic transit-time probe during routine hemodialysis in 64 patients was 9.0% +/- 2.7% less than pump meter readings when Pa varied from -180 to -220 torr.
 Blood pump meter readings greater than 400 ml/min were usually inaccurate because of low Pa.
 Prepump monitoring of arterial inflow pressure can prevent hidden reductions in blood flow that decrease dialysis efficiency.

"Rapid visual colorimetry of peritoneal lavage fluid.
 STUDY HYPOTHESIS: That visual colorimetry can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid.
 POPULATION: Fifty-four normal adult human subjects.
 METHODS: The automated or chamber RBC count is often used on fluid obtained by peritoneal lavage in patients with abdominal trauma to help determine the need for surgery.
 Unfortunately, this method sometimes results in excessive delay.
 We designed and built a simple colorimeter that facilitated rapid direct visual comparison of unknown samples with known color standards.
 A radiograph view box was used as a light source.
 Standards were prepared in 16-mm glass tubes to simulate peritoneal lavage fluid with RBC counts ranging from 0 to 140,000 in 10,000 cell/microL increments; 1:5 dilutions with water were used throughout to reduce opacity.
 Thimerosal was added to unknowns and standards to stabilize color; all samples were kept refrigerated at 4 C when not in use.
 In a double-blind in-vitro study, each subject matched 20 randomly distributed unknowns ranging from 12,000 to 131,000 erythrocytes/microL to the nearest standard.
 RESULTS: The mean absolute error for all 1,080 determinations was 3,560 RBC/microL (95% CI = 4,290-4,830; SD = 4,560; t = 39.6; df = 1,079; P less than .001).
 This method correctly predicted the RBC count to within 9,000 cells/microL 95% of the time.
 CONCLUSION: Visual comparison of 1:5 dilutions of simulated peritoneal lavage fluid with known color standards can be used to rapidly and precisely estimate the erythrocyte count.

 Angioscopic information from 18 patients with an infrainguinal bypass graft led to graft revision in six cases and placement of a new graft in 10 cases.
 One graft limb was replaced in seven aortobifemoral grafts, and multiple repeated thrombectomies were employed to extract debris in the remaining six cases.
 Repeated graft thrombectomy was also beneficial in dialysis access fistulas.
 Angioscopy allowed us to omit the completion angiogram and led to an improved technical result.
 We conclude that angioscopy is useful during thromboembolectomy procedures.

 Histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy in a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome following L-tryptophan use showed prominent lymphocytic perineuritis, neuritis, and perimysial fasciitis.
 The presence of perineuritis and neuritis provides a histopathologic basis for clinical features of neuropathy in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and occurred in conjunction with a fasciitis or interstitial myositis that was predominantly perimysial and focally endomysial.

"Plasma cross linked fibrin degradation products in pulmonary embolism.
 Plasma concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products, a marker of intravascular thrombosis and fibrinolysis, were measured in 495 patients with suspected pulmonary embolism referred for ventilation-perfusion lung scanning to determine whether concentrations are increased in pulmonary embolism and their potential use in diagnosis.
 Lung scans were described as normal (n = 66) or as showing a low (n = 292), indeterminate (n = 58), or high probability (n = 79) of pulmonary embolism.
 There was a difference between the mean levels of cross linked fibrin degradation products in each scan category: normal scans, 142 ng/ml; low probability scans, 295 ng/ml; indeterminate probability scans, 510 ng/ml; high probability scans, 952 ng/ml (p less than 0.001).
 Of the patients with high probability scans, 96% had raised concentrations.
 Explanations for discrepant low results include incorrect scan diagnosis, delay in blood sampling, and anticoagulation.
 Of the patients with a low or indeterminate probability of pulmonary embolism, 43% had increased concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products that could be attributed in most cases to another illness.
 Owing to the wide range of values in each lung scan diagnostic category, raised concentrations of these fibrin degradation products cannot be used without reference to the patient's clinical state as a discriminatory test for pulmonary embolism.
 Further evaluation of the significance of normal concentrations in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism appears to be warranted.

"Diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia by ultrastructural examination of exfoliative cytologic specimens.
 Lingual exfoliative cytologic specimens (scrapings) were obtained from 18 patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus with clinical oral hairy leukoplakia.
 Buccal mucosal scrapings were obtained from 12 of these patients.
 The specimens were processed for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
 Sixteen (89%) of the lingual specimens revealed infection of keratinocytes by herpes-type virus.
 There was no evidence of virus infection in the 12 buccal mucosal scrapings.
 Fungal hyphae were seen by TEM in 14 (78%) of the lingual scrapings and two (17%) of the buccal scrapings.
 One exfoliative specimen and two biopsy specimens were stained for Epstein-Barr virus DNA with a DNA probe.
 The demonstration of herpes-type virions by TEM in keratinocytes from a lesion clinically suspected to be hairy leukoplakia provides direct, objective diagnosis.
 Furthermore, use of exfoliative cytologic specimens provides a clinically simple, noninvasive technique.

 Acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen are extremely useful markers for the management of patients with prostatic carcinoma.
 Prostatic acid phosphatase, because of its relatively low sensitivity and specificity, as well as analyte instability and diurnal variability, is unsuitable for prostate cancer screening.
 Improved performance characteristics, stability, the lesser diurnal variation, and the association of elevated prostate-specific antigen with prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia make prostate-specific antigen possibly a better candidate for early detection of this common malignancy.
 Further investigations in this area are clearly indicated before we can recommend screening with prostate-specific antigen.

"Hypothermia and acidosis worsen coagulopathy in the patient requiring massive transfusion.
 Massive transfusion may cause abnormalities of electrolytes, clotting factors, pH, and temperature and may occur in a scenario of refractory coagulopathy and irreversible shock.
 Identification of correctable variables to improve survival is complicated by the interplay of this pathophysiology.
 Temperature may be an under-appreciated problem in the genesis of coagulopathy.
 In vitro studies have demonstrated that platelet function and vascular response are critically temperature-dependent.
 We reviewed the records of 45 trauma patients without head injury or co-morbid medical illness who required massive transfusions.
 The mean Injury Severity Score was 55 +/- 6, a mean of 22.5 +/- 5 units of blood was transfused, and mortality was 33%.
 Nonsurvivors were more likely to have had penetrating injury (88% versus 55%), received more transfusions (26.5 +/- 9 versus 18.6 +/- 1, p less than 0.05), had lower pH (pH 7.04 +/- 0.06 versus 7.18 +/- 0.02, p less than 0.05), had lower core temperature (31 +/- 1 degree C versus 34 +/- 1 degree C, p less than 0.01), and had a higher incidence of clinical coagulopathy (73% versus 23%).
 Severe hypothermia (temperature less than 34 degrees C) occurred in 80% of the nonsurvivors and in 36% of survivors.
 Patients who were hypothermic and acidotic developed clinically significant bleeding despite adequate blood, plasma, and platelet replacement.
 Avoidance or correction of hypothermia may be critical in preventing or correcting coagulopathy in the patient receiving massive transfusion.

"Secondary prevention of acute myocardial infarction with beta-blocking agents and calcium antagonists.
 The discovery that beta blockers possess clinically useful hypotensive, antianginal and antiarrhythmic properties has attracted the interest of clinicians, researchers and the pharmaceutical community alike.
 In addition, minor differences in a variety of ancillary properties have led to speculation that specific classes of drugs might have advantages over other classes.
 The enthusiasm that greeted reports from the first small trials, which showed that beta blockers reduced the postmyocardial infarction mortality rate, attracted the commercial support necessary to evaluate different beta blockers in this clinical setting.
 The plethora of beta blockers that subsequently became available for study led to considerable improvement in both the design and implementation of large clinical trials.
 Despite apparent discrepancies in the results of various trials, meta-analysis indicates that most, if not all, beta blockers reduce postinfarction mortality.
 However, because meta-analysis cannot recommend a particular drug or specific dose for use in an individual patient, clinical practice must be based on the results of individual trials, not on the conclusions of meta-analysis.
 The clinical utility of beta blockers in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction, coupled with experimental evidence that calcium antagonists reduce infarct size, led to a series of large studies designed to establish whether calcium antagonists have any effect on reducing mortality in patients with myocardial infarction.
 Lessons learned from the beta-blocker trials permitted a more rapid evaluation of the efficacy of calcium antagonists in this setting.
 It is clear that, unlike beta blockers, calcium antagonists are not effective in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction.

"Time course and prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms after a first acute myocardial infarction.
 The prognostic significance of serial signal-averaged electrocardiograms recorded during the first 3 days (period 1), in the second week (period 2) after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and 6 months later (period 3) was prospectively assessed in 190 patients.
 No patients were treated with thrombolytic therapy.
 Patients with conduction disturbances were excluded.
 Mean age of the 190 patients was 57 years (range 34 to 74) and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 40 + 6% (range 12 to 70).
 Eighty-four patients had an anterior wall AMI and the remaining 106 patients an inferior wall AMI.
 After a mean follow-up of 24 months, 16 patients developed sustained symptomatic monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, 7 patients were resuscitated from an episode of ventricular fibrillation, and 10 patients died suddenly.
 Multivariate regression analysis using continuous variables showed that the strongest predictor of sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was the left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.0001) followed by the duration of QRS complex on the signal-averaged electrocardiogram recorded during the first 3 days of AMI (p less than 0.0005).
 Sudden death was only predicted by left ventricular ejection fraction (p less than 0.02).

"Expression of rat prolactin-like protein B in deciduoma of pseudopregnant rat and in decidua during early pregnancy.
 The rat PRL-like protein-B (rPLP-B) complementary DNA (cDNA), originally cloned from a late term placental library, hybridizes to transcripts in the deciduoma tissue artificially produced in pseudopregnant rats.
 The expression of rPLP-B in deciduoma is first observed 48 h (pseudopregnancy day 7) after the deciduogenic stimulus and increases to a maximum by 96-120 h (pseudopregnancy day 9-10).
 In situ hybridization studies show that rPLP-B hybridizes specifically to the antimesometrial cells of deciduoma tissue in day 9 pseudopregnant rats and to the homologous cells of the decidua that surround the embryo-trophoblastic structure at day 9 of pregnancy.
 A temporal study on the expression of rPLP-B during pregnancy shows that rPLP-B is concomitantly expressed by the decidual cells of maternal origin and the cytotrophoblast of fetal origin around day 13 of pregnancy.

"Acetabular dysplasia in the adolescent and young adult.
 Hip dysplasia is a major cause of osteoarthrosis in adults.
 Early aggressive osteotomy has the potential of preventing the development of arthritis, but carries with it significant risks.
 The problem is further complicated because the surgeon has no means of quantifying the dysplastic deformity or of predicting what a particular combination of osteotomies would do to correct the deformity.
 This study describes methods of quantifying hip-joint geometry in three dimensions based on computed tomography and magnetic resonance studies, and of simulating pelvic osteotomy to correct the deformities.
 The study analyzes 49 normal hip joints and 20 dysplastic hip joints.
 The results show that the normal acetabulum is nearly a full hemisphere, which is anteverted 20 degrees and abducted 53 degrees.
 The normal lateral center-edge angle is 37 degrees.
 The dysplastic acetabulum is not anterolaterally maldirected, as has been assumed, but is globally dysplastic.
 Analysis of the individual dysplastic hip joints showed a wide variability.
 Some patients were deficient globally, some anterolaterally, and some posterolaterally.
 Methods of analyzing a patient's hip joint, quantifying abnormalities, simulating surgery, and predicting results are demonstrated in a case example.

"Full-length recombinant CD4 and recombinant gp120 inhibit fusion between HIV infected macrophages and uninfected CD4-expressing T-lymphoblastoid cells.
 Human immunodeficiency virus-(HIV) infected monocyte-macrophages may contribute to the pathogenesis of HIV-associated immune deficiency and dysfunction by acting as a target and potential reservoir for the virus in vivo, and by functioning abnormally following infection.
 We have shown that HIV-infected macrophages fuse with uninfected CD4-expressing lymphoid cells in vitro; this may provide an additional mechanism for CD4 lymphocyte depletion in vivo.
 We report here the inhibition of syncytium formation between HIV-infected macrophages and uninfected CD4-expressing T-lymphoid cells by monoclonal antibody S3.5, directed against an epitope of CD4 involved in binding HIV gp120, by a recombinant protein that comprises the full-length extracellular domain of the CD4 molecule, and by recombinant full-length HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120.
 These results indicate that both molecules (gp120 and CD4) are critical to the fusion process, and suggest that gp120 is expressed on the surface of HIV-infected monocyte-macrophages.

 We tested whether anesthesia that includes nitrous oxide (N2O) results in the development of intraoperative and postoperative pulmonary complications, including hypoxemia.
 We also tested whether aging contributes to the development of such complications, particularly when anesthesia includes N2O.
 We randomly allocated patients having total hip replacements, carotid endarterectomies, or transsphenoidal hypophysectomies (total n = 270) to an anesthetic regimen with and without N2O (stratified within surgical group).
 A heat-and-moisture exchanger was included in the anesthetic circuit of all patients.
 Patients were monitored perioperatively and for 1 wk after surgery using intermittent and continuous pulse oximetry to determine oxyhemoglobin saturation.
 Intraoperatively, mean oxygen (O2) saturations were lower in patients given N2O, particularly older patients.
 Hypoxemia (O2 saturation less than 86%) developed in five patients receiving N2O and in one receiving O2.
 This difference was not significant.
 Administration of N2O did not decrease postoperative O2 saturation, nor did it alter the incidence of postoperative hypoxemia, cough, or sputum production.

"Selective nonoperative management of patients referred with abnormal mammograms.
 Screening mammography provides a means of detecting clinically occult breast carcinoma, but the question of whether all abnormal mammograms require biopsy remains unanswered.
 We retrospectively reviewed records of 214 women referred over an 8-year period for abnormal mammograms.
 They were selectively assigned to biopsy or mammographic follow-up based on specific mammographic criteria.
 Of 114 women initially observed mammographically, 2 were later found by biopsy to have carcinoma.
 Initial assignment to mammographic observation delayed the recommendation for biopsy 3 and 12 months, respectively, in these patients, but no effect on outcome was documented.
 Because they have benign lesions by clinical and mammographic criteria, 102 women (53%) have been spared biopsy; they continue to be monitored closely.
 We believe these data support the use of a selective approach to biopsy based on specific mammographic criteria.

"Impaired polymorphonuclear leucocyte function in patients undergoing hepatectomy: adenylate energy charge and superoxide anion production in relation to hepatic mitochondrial redox state.
 Patients undergoing hepatectomy have an increased susceptibility to infection.
 We therefore studied the energy metabolism of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN), focusing on energy charge and function, especially superoxide anion (O2-) generation, in relation to the hepatic mitochondrial redox state.
 By labelling the PMN adenine nucleotide pool with radioactive adenine and by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, the energy charge and O2- production was measured in 18 patients with hepatoma (non-cirrhotic, seven; cirrhotic, 11) undergoing hepatectomy.
 Their arterial ketone body ratios (KBRs), reflecting the hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were above 0.7 before operation.
 After surgery, the 18 patients were divided into two groups: group A, KBR greater than 0.7, n = 10; and group B, KBR less than 0.7, n = 8.
 The energy charge and O2- release in group B decreased significantly from preoperative values (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01 respectively) and when compared with group A (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively).
 These results suggest that impaired hepatic energy metabolism (KBR less than 0.7) in hepatectomized patients leads to impaired energy charge and O2- production in the PMNs.

"Delayed detection of coarctation in infancy: implications for timing of newborn follow-up.
 During a recent 5-year period, 74 patients younger than 6 months of age were diagnosed with coarctation of the aorta.
 Coarctation was correctly diagnosed in only 22% of patients prior to referral despite readily apparent femoral pulse abnormalities in 86%.
 Infants whose symptoms were detected between 5 and 14 days of age were significantly more ill than infants outside this age range and had a high mortality rate (25%).
 The number of associated cardiac defects was not related to the severity of clinical illness in this group, suggesting that closure of the ductus arteriosus is the primary determinate of disease severity.
 Observations in two patients suggested that a detectable pulse discrepancy occurs between 3 and 5 days postnatally.
 Upper extremity hypertension was found commonly in infants after 5 days of age despite the presence of congestive heart failure.
 Earlier detection of coarctation in the newborn requires a diligent cardiovascular and peripheral pulse examination between 3 and 7 days of life, upper extremity and lower extremity blood pressure measurement, and a high index of suspicion.

 We analyzed extended haplotypes composed of DNA loci on the short arm of chromosome 11 for segregation with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus.
 The markers for these loci are tyrosine hydroxylase, insulin, and c-Ha-ras-1 proto-oncogene (HRAS1).
 We report, in a study of 27 families, that a specific haplotype (H), containing a 3-kilobase (kb) HRAS1-Taq I DNA polymorphism, segregated differentially in diabetic and nondiabetic siblings (P = 0.005).
 A parallel population study showed that the 3-kb HRAS1-Taq I polymorphism is increased in frequency in type I patients having two strong HLA-susceptibility haplotypes compared with other type I patients or healthy control blood donors (P less than 0.010 and P less than 0.025, respectively).
 The polymorphic variable, enhancer, and promoter regions flanking the human insulin gene on the H haplotype were not associated with type I diabetes.

"The encased ureter: bullet and bodkin pattern, a reliable radiographic sign.
 Among the causes of constricted ureter is benign or malignant encasement.
 The diagnosis of ureteric encasement is frequently overlooked, even by well informed clinicians and radiologists.
 The most common benign cause is retroperitoneal fibrosis and the most frequent malignant causes are extension from an adjacent primary tumour, true metastases to the ureter and lymphoma.
 Lack of recognition of the process may lead to mistaken diagnosis of an inflammatory stricture or infiltrating transitional cell tumour, with resultant inappropriate management.
 A sign which appears to be almost specific for encasement, the bullet and bodkin configuration, is described here.
 Newer imaging modalities such as computed tomography and ultrasound, while helpful, are probably less sensitive and less specific than the retrograde ureterogram because a detectable mass is not always present.

"Arthrometric evaluation of knees that have a torn anterior cruciate ligament.
 We used the KT-1000 arthrometer to test the knees of 107 patients who had an acute tear of the anterior cruciate ligament, 153 patients who had a chronic tear, and 141 control subjects, for a total of 401 individuals.
 The three testing parameters were the extent of anterior translation at eighty-nine newtons of force and at maximum manual force, and the compliance index.
 The differences between the involved and the uninvolved knees were calculated.
 At eighty-nine newtons, all but one of the control subjects had anterior translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 58 per cent of the patients who had a chronic tear.
 At maximum manual force, all but two of the control subjects had translation of ten millimeters or less, compared with 20 per cent of the patients who had an acute or a chronic tear.
 Analysis of variance showed that the clinical diagnosis correlated well with the results for all tests (p less than 0.001).
 However, when the uninjured knees of patients who had an acute or a chronic tear were compared with the knees of the control subjects, significant differences were noted (p less than 0.001 to 0.006).
 In the patients who had a chronic tear, there was no relationship between the time from injury to operation and the extent of anterior translation.
 The arthrometric test at maximum manual force was the strongest discriminant; it differentiated normal from abnormal knees (p less than 0.001) with high sensitivity (92 per cent), high specificity (95 per cent), and high positive predictive accuracy; the cut-off point was eleven millimeters or less.

"Electrophysiological spectrum of inclusion body myositis.
 We present electrodiagnostic data on 30 patients with inclusion body myositis (IBM) in order to better delineate its electrophysiological features.
 Comprehensive electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) were performed in all cases.
 Twelve patients had single fiber electromyography (SFEMG).
 EMG showed abundant short-small motor unit potentials (MUP) with fibrillations and positive sharp waves in 56.6% of patients, and a mixed pattern of large and small MUP in 36.7%.
 In 6.7%, only ""neurogenic"" features were seen.
 NCS were slow in 33.3%.
 SFEMG revealed a mildly abnormal jitter and a slightly increased fiber density.
 IBM demonstrates a heterogeneous EMG profile.
 A pattern of large and small MUP is highly suggestive of IBM but is seen in only about one third of cases.

"Lateralized effects of subclinical epileptiform EEG discharges on scholastic performance in children.
 The interaction between lateralization of subclinical epileptiform discharges and cognitive tasks was investigated in 21 children (12 girls and 9 boys, mean age 10.6 years).
 Seventeen had a diagnosis of epilepsy (partial or secondarily generalized).
 Testing was by reading, arithmetic, and intelligence subtests during continuous telemetric EEG and video monitoring.
 Children with left-sided discharges had significantly lower reading performance than children with right-sided discharges.
 During reading, epileptiform discharges occurred relatively less frequently and with a shorter total duration over the left hemisphere than the right.
 This supports the view that cognitive tasks suppress epileptiform discharges when they activate a region of the brain within the epileptogenic zone.
 Discharges from other epileptogenic zones not directly activated by the tasks are increased, however.

"Thickness of carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque and ischemic risk.
 Noninvasive duplex scanning of carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque was performed in 286 consecutive patients referred to a cerebrovascular diagnostic laboratory.
 The presence and thickness of such plaque in the region of the carotid bifurcation were examined for association with the degree of vessel stenosis, age, sex, smoking history, history of prior transient ischemic attack or stroke, and systemic manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.
 Atherosclerotic plaque thickness was positively correlated with degree of vessel stenosis (P less than 0.0001).
 Both parameters were independent predictors of cerebrovascular events but plaque thickness was a better predictor of prior transient ischemic attacks (P less than 0.05), and vessel stenosis was a better predictor of prior stroke (P less than 0.005).
 Patient age (P less than 0.001) and pack-years of cigarette use (P less than 0.001) were independent positive predictors of carotid atherosclerotic plaque thickness.
 The greatest effect of smoking and atherosclerotic plaque thickness was seen in heavy smokers younger than age 55.
 Both carotid artery plaque thickness and pack-years of smoking were significant independent predictors of other systemic manifestations of atherosclerotic disease (P less than 0.05).
 Such noninvasive scanning of carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque demonstrates the significant role of age and smoking in the progression of disease.
 It also suggests a significant role for carotid atherosclerotic artery plaque in the pathophysiology of cerebrovascular events, especially transient ischemic attacks, even prior to the production of a flow-limiting stenosis.
 Finally, noninvasive screening of carotid artery plaque may provide a useful marker for the patient at risk for systemic atherosclerotic disease and identify the patient for whom maximal atherosclerotic risk factor modification is needed.

"Utility of frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes in the staging of bronchogenic carcinoma at mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy.
 We conducted a retrospective analysis of the utility of frozen-section diagnoses in determining lymph node status at mediastinoscopy in 122 consecutive patients with bronchogenic carcinoma.
 Thirty-five of 122 patients had one or more lymph nodes with frozen-section evaluation positive for metastatic carcinoma.
 Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-section study revealed metastatic carcinoma in two additional patients.
 The false-negative rate was 1.6%.
 Sensitivity was 94.6%.
 Predictive value of negative frozen-section evaluation results was 97.7%.
 Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section evaluation were 100%.
 The statuses of individual lymph nodes from these 122 patients were also evaluated.
 Six hundred twenty lymph nodes were sampled from the mediastinum at mediastinoscopy.
 Frozen-sections in 47 lymph nodes were positive.
 Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-sections examination revealed metastatic carcinoma in four additional lymph nodes.
 The false-negative rate was 0.6%.
 Sensitivity was 92.2%.
 Predictive value of negative results from frozen-section evaluation was 99.3%.
 Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section examination were 100%.
 We conclude that frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes at mediastinoscopy reliably indicates lymph node status, thus enabling the physician to decide whether to proceed to thoracotomy.
 Thus staging of the carcinoma and definitive surgery can be accomplished during a single anesthetic procedure.
 Combining mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy with frozen-section diagnostic control also reduces both the length and cost of hospitalization.

"Mechanisms in heart failure and the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
 The four major diagnostic criteria for the syndrome of congestive heart failure are left ventricular dysfunction, exercise intolerance, pulmonary congestion or edema and ventricular arrhythmias.
 Activation of norepinephrine, angiotensin II, vasopressin and atrial natriuretic peptide may be a key factor in the vasoconstriction and increased impedance to left ventricular ejection in heart failure.
 Interventions that interfere with these vasoconstrictor mechanisms should have a salutary effect on left ventricular performance.
 Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, alpha-adrenoceptor blockers and vasopressin antagonists has resulted in hemodynamic benefits, but it has been more difficult to demonstrate long-term clinical effectiveness.
 Reductions in mortality have been demonstrated in patients with heart failure treated with vasodilators and ACE inhibitors.
 Improvement in the quality of life and prolongation of life are the only two appropriate goals in the management of heart failure.
 Further understanding of the role of angiotensin II and its interference by ACE inhibition in the tissue processes of heart failure is needed.

"Use of latex agglutination technique for detecting Legionella pneumophila (serogroup 1) antibodies.
 Following the outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in Stafford in 1985, 500 serum samples were submitted to the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test and a latex agglutination.
 Latex agglutination using ultrasonically disrupted Legionella pneumophila antigens coupled to latex particles, proved a rapid, simple method for detecting circulating antibodies to L pneumophila in a one minute slide latex agglutination test.
 There was good correlation with the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), and the specificity and sensitivity with respect to a diagnostic result were 98.3% and 97.6%, respectively, using a series of well characterised sera.
 The latex agglutination test seems well suited as a screening test for presumptive cases of Legionnaires' disease; the latex reagent is easy to prepare and seems to remain stable at 4 degrees C for up to six months.

 Rewarming of a cooled rabbit leg was associated with the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals, shown to be instrumental for tissue injury occurring during rewarming.
 The present study used a compound that, by its ability to bind with free iron, can remove hydroxyl radical (OH.) from tissue.
 Deferoxamine reduced tissue injury during cooling and rewarming, as evidenced by its ability to decrease tissue release of lactic acid dehydrogenase and creatine kinase.
 Deferoxamine also reduced the formation of OH.

 This compound did not have any effect on the arterial blood flow pattern, which uniformly decreased during cooling and was restored during rewarming.

"Hemopump ventricular support for patients undergoing high risk coronary angioplasty.
 Prophylactic implantation of a Hemopump (Johnson and Johnson, Skillman, NJ) has been evaluated in nine patients selected for high risk coronary angioplasty.
 They were unstable patients, refractory to maximal pharmacology, with indications for revascularization, but contraindications for surgery such as low ejection fraction and lack of material for bypass.
 In all, the target lesion was located on the last patent vessel.
 The pump was inserted under local anesthesia, without any graft.
 A specially designed occluder permitted avoidance of retrograde bleeding during implantation.
 The bypass flow ranged from 2.5 to 3.2 L/min, and permitted a rise in cardiac index from 2.05 to 2.55 L/min/m2, with a drop in capillary wedge pressure from 13 (7-18) to 10 (7-13) mmHg.
 During balloon inflation, no electrocardiographic changes were observed, because only minor ventricular arrhythmias occurred.
 No significant hemolysis was seen (plasma free hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl in all) after 2 hr of pumping.
 The only limitation of the technique appears to be difficulty at the time of implantation from narrow, stenosed, or tortuous iliofemoral arteries (3 patients).
 This experience strongly supports the benefit of temporary left ventricular Hemopump support in high-risk situations and clearly shows the need for a smaller pump.

"Lack of change in neurochemical markers during the postepileptic phase of intrahippocampal tetanus toxin syndrome in rats.
 The chronic epileptic syndrome induced by injecting tetanus toxin into rat hippocampus causes functional changes that essentially are permanent, outlasting the period of active seizures by at least 1 year.
 These long-term changes have been characterized by an impaired performance on a range of behavioral tasks, which in turn have been associated with a physiologic depression of hippocampal evoked responses but not with any discernible histopathology.
 In the present study, we examined the hippocampi of rats in the postseizure phase of the tetanus toxin model and observed no significant changes in the concentration of neurochemical markers for six neurotransmitters.
 Therefore, the long-term reduction in hippocampal excitability cannot be attributed to any major loss of afferents or hippocampal neurons using aspartate, acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, norepinephrine (NE), or serotonin as their transmitters.

"Excess deaths from nine chronic diseases in the United States, 1986 
 To assess excess mortality from chronic disease in the United States, state age-adjusted combined mortality rates for nine chronic diseases in 1986 were compared with three ""minimum"" rates--two calculated from rates actually achieved in states and a third estimated as the mortality remaining after elimination of one risk factor for each disease.
 Hawaii had the lowest mortality rate of combined diseases (305/100,000); state excesses ranged from 0% to 37%.
 The sum of lowest disease-specific rates in any state was 284 per 100,000, indicating excesses of between 7% and 41%.
 A minimum mortality rate of 224 per 100,000 was estimated to result from elimination of one risk factor for each of the nine diseases, indicating state excesses from 26% to 54%, or 524,000 US deaths.
 Reduction of US mortality from the nine diseases to the risk factor--eliminated rate is estimated to be associated with an increased life expectancy at birth of 4 years.

"Angiographic assessment of the culprit coronary artery lesion before acute myocardial infarction.
 Serial angiographic studies of patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina suggest that the culprit plaque underlying a thrombus need not have produced severe luminal obstruction before onset of the event.
 An atherosclerotic coronary artery lesion can, therefore, have 2 important characteristics.
 First, it may be obstructive.
 Second, it may be ""vulnerable"" in that it has the potential to become thrombogenic if exposed to the appropriate triggering stimulus.
 A lesion need not be obstructive to become thrombogenic, nor do all obstructive lesions have thrombogenic potential.
 The cause of an infarction may thus be rupture of a nonobstructive plaque leading to occlusive thrombus formation.
 Because it may be difficult to predict the site of a subsequent occlusion from a coronary angiogram, coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty directed only at discernible stenotic lesions may not be effective for preventing subsequent myocardial infarctions.
 Appropriate therapy may need to be directed at the entire coronary tree.
 Such therapy might include cholesterol lowering, beta blockade and aspirin.

"Phenotypic and functional characterization of T cells from patients with myasthenia gravis.
 A study of cell surface phenotypes of PBL of myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed that their T cells had a significantly higher percentage of 4B4+ T cells (the helper/inducer subset) than age- and sex-matched controls.
 The PBL of MG patients proliferated significantly higher than those of normal subjects (NS) in response to the purified alpha chain of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR).
 Anti-AChR antibody was present in sera of 88% of MG and none of the NS.
 The PBL B cells from MG only, when cultured with autologous T cells and stimulated with either pokeweed mitogen (69%), or AChR-alpha chain (38%), secreted antibody to AChR-alpha chain, whereas T and B cells alone secreted no antibody.
 T cells from PBL of MG patients were more readily cloned than T cells of NS, by limiting dilution, in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and in the absence of AChR-alpha chain.
 About 50% of T cell clones from MG patients, compared to none from NS, proliferated to AChR-alpha chain.
 This response was HLA-DR restricted.
 MG T cell clones did not display significant cytotoxic activity, as compared to control T cell clones.
 Our results indicate that in MG, 4B4+ regulatory T cells play their role in the pathogenesis of MG, not by cytotoxicity, but more likely by their ability to stimulate specific antibody production by B cells.

"Medroxyprogesterone acetate lowers plasma corticotropin and cortisol but does not suppress anterior pituitary responsiveness to human corticotropin releasing factor.
 The endocrine action of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) has been claimed to be of a glucocorticoid-like nature.
 Upon clinical observation, MPA has been shown to improve life quality and overall well-being in patients with advanced breast cancer, renal carcinoma, prostatic carcinoma, and uterine adenocarcinoma.
 The authors have evaluated MPA endocrine action by the administration of human corticotropin releasing factor (hCRF) in a 90-minute assay in 15 patients with advanced breast cancer or renal cell carcinoma both, before the initiation of oral high-dose MPA treatment (1000 mg MPA) as well as after at least 10 days of therapy.
 The curves for corticotropin, beta-endorphin, and cortisol responses to hCRF of tumor patients who were tested before the initiation of MPA treatment were parallel to the curves of a healthy control group of probands tested under equal conditions, although at significantly higher respective hormone levels.
 In patients with malignant disorders assayed after MPA administration, both basal and peak hormone levels were found to be comparable with values obtained in healthy controls.
 In conclusion, MPA appeared to act at a suprapituitary level since pituitary responsiveness to hCRF was preserved under MPA treatment.
 Moreover, it appeared that MPA brought the hormonal stress state found in patients with malignant tumors back to normal.

 The effect of heat stress on blood flow and metabolism in an exercising leg was studied in seven subjects walking uphill (12-17%) at 5 km/h on a treadmill for 90 min or until exhaustion.
 The first 30 min of exercise were performed in a cool environment (18-21 degrees C); then subjects moved to an adjacent room at 40 degrees C and continued to exercise at the same speed and inclination for a further 60 min or to exhaustion, whichever occurred first.
 The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums.
 In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min.

 There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat.
 Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment.
 There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced.

 Serum PTH was measured with an intact molecule immunochemiluminometric assay and 1,25(OH)2D was measured with radioimmunoassay after HPLC separation.
 Hypertensive men had PTH levels that were 36% higher than normotensive men (5.3 +/- 2.9 v 3.9 +/- 0.8 pmol/L, P = .005).
 When blood pressure was analyzed as a continuous variable, there was a direct correlation between it and serum PTH in men (r = .31, P = .004).

 Blood pressure was inversely correlated with serum phosphorus levels in both sexes (r = -0.20, P = .04).
 In men, the elevated serum PTH levels and depressed serum phosphorus levels would have predicted that serum 1,25(OH)2D would be higher in the hypertensive subjects.

 The case series of a population-based case-control study of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in Torino, Italy, included 281 men with clinical and anamnestic data.
 Two hundred fifteen, 28, and 38 cancers originated from the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx, respectively.
 Regions invaded by the tumor were divided into 26 subsites.
 A classification based on the number of invaded subsites was proposed, which agreed well with the T classification of the TNM system.
 Cancers originating from the hypopharynx invaded more subsites than cancers from the endolarynx, and among the latter, supraglottic were more invasive than glottic lesions.
 The number of invaded subsites was strongly associated with nodal involvement.
 Among symptoms at onset of disease and at diagnosis, patients with endolaryngeal lesions reported dysphonia and dyspnea more frequently, and patients with lesions from other regions had a higher prevalence of dysphagia, odynophagia, otalgia, and adenopathia.
 Clinical and epidemiologic results of this study suggest considering the endolarynx, epilarynx, and hypopharynx as separate anatomic entities.
 Diagnostic delay was not associated with tumor size and showed a negative trend with involvement of cervical lymph nodes, suggesting that stage at diagnosis is due to intrinsic differences in tumor aggressiveness.

"Underexpression of beta cell high Km glucose transporters in noninsulin-dependent diabetes [published erratum appears in Science 1990 Nov 30;250(4985):1195]
 The role of defective glucose transport in the pathogenesis of noninsulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) was examined in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of NIDDM.
 As in human NIDDM, insulin secretion was unresponsive to 20 mM glucose.
 Uptake of 3-O-methylglucose by islet cells was less than 19% of controls.
 The beta cell glucose transporter (GLUT-2) immunoreactivity and amount of GLUT-2 messenger RNA were profoundly reduced.
 Whenever fewer than 60% of beta cells were GLUT-2-positive, the response to glucose was absent and hyperglycemia exceeded 11 mM plasma glucose.
 We conclude that in NIDDM underexpression of GLUT-2 messenger RNA lowers high Km glucose transport in beta cells, and thereby impairs glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and prevents correction of hyperglycemia.

 Moreover, 67% of patients in Group 1 experienced frequent episodes of moderate-to-severe postoperative pain in contrast to 40% of patients in Group 2 and only 10% of patients in Group 3.
 As a result of diminished pain, greater joint motion was obtained within the first 72 hours in Groups 2 and 3.
 They also had shorter hospitalization (9.6 days versus 11.2 days for Group 1 and 10.8 days for Group 2).
 However, the use of epidural analgesia did not reduce the incidence of complications, including nausea.
 Continuous infusion of epidural bupivacaine and Duramorph provided good-to-excellent control of postoperative pain after TKA.
 However, better analgesics are needed to reduce the high incidence of side effects associated with various treatment methods.

"Interactions between substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, taurine and excitatory amino acids in the spinal cord.
 Using in vivo microdialysis in the dorsal spinal cord of the rat, we have previously observed increases in glutamate and aspartate during exposure to a noxious stimulus.
 The present investigation was designed to determine whether these increases may be mediated by substance P.
 Infusion of 1 mM of substance P in the dialysis fluid increased the concentrations of glutamate and aspartate, similar to the response seen during noxious stimulation.
 In addition, substance P also increased the concentrations of the inhibitory amino acids glycine and taurine.
 Calcitonin gene-related peptide, previously shown to enhance substance P-induced biting and scratching behavior, produced no effect on amino acid release by itself but potentiated the apparent release of taurine by substance P.
 To assess the importance of substance P-induced amino acid release in sensory processing, we examined the influence of taurine and of excitatory amino acid antagonists on the biting and scratching behavior produced by excitatory amino acids and substance P.
 Taurine selectively inhibited only substance P-induced biting and scratching while excitatory amino acid antagonists inhibited only excitatory amino acid-induced behavior.
 To further explore the ability of taurine to inhibit the substance P-induced behavior, 3 tests of nociception were then used.
 Pretreatment with taurine inhibited the nociceptive-related writhing behavior produced by an intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid in mice but failed to alter the latency of response in the hot plate or tail flick assay.

"Poly(L-lactide) implants in repair of defects of the orbital floor: an animal study.
 Because of the life-long presence of alloplastic, nonresorbable orbital floor implants and the complications of their use mentioned in literature, the use of a resorbable material appears to be preferable in the repair of orbital floor defects.
 A high-molecular-weight, as-polymerized poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) was used for repair of orbital floor defects of the blowout type in goats.
 An artificial defect was created in the bony floor of both orbits.
 Reconstruction of the orbital floor was then carried out using a concave PLLA implant of 0.4-mm thickness.
 At 3, 6, 12, 19, 26, 52, and 78 weeks postoperatively, one goat was killed.
 Microscopic examination showed full encapsulation of the implant by connective tissue after 3 weeks.
 After 6 weeks, resorption and remodeling of the bone at the points of support of the implant could be detected.
 A differentiation between the sinus and orbital sides of the connective tissue capsule was observed.
 The orbital side showed a significantly more dense capsule than the antral side, which had a loose appearance.
 At 19 weeks, a bony plate was progressively being formed, and at 78 weeks, new bone had fully covered the plate on the antral and orbital side.
 No inflammation or rejection of the PLLA implant was seen.

"Effects of brief coronary occlusion and reperfusion on porcine coronary artery reactivity.
 The loss of coronary vasodilator reserve after ischemia-reperfusion may be due to endothelial injury, and this vascular dysfunction may contribute to functional alterations observed after ischemia.
 To determine whether endothelial dysfunction occurs after relatively brief periods of moderate low-flow ischemia in vivo, open-chest swine were subjected to 15 minutes of critical, subtotal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (80%) followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion.
 Serial measurements of regional coronary flow were made with the radiolabeled microsphere technique.
 After 60 minutes of reperfusion, the left anterior descending coronary artery was excised together with a section of the normally perfused left circumflex coronary artery to examine in vitro the relaxations to the endothelium-dependent dilators ADP and bradykinin and to the endothelial-independent dilators sodium nitroprusside and adenosine.
 Contractions to serotonin in quiescent rings were also examined.
 Endocardial and transmural blood flows recovered to preocclusion levels within 60 minutes of reperfusion, as did the epicardial-to-endocardial ratio.
 Vascular responses in isolated, reperfused left anterior descending coronary artery rings were significantly different from responses in control left circumflex coronary artery rings.
 Endothelium-dependent relaxations to adenosine diphosphate and bradykinin were significantly depressed in the left anterior descending coronary artery rings compared with left circumflex coronary artery rings (p less than 0.05).
 Serotonin-induced contractions were significantly greater in occluded-reperfused left anterior descending than in left circumflex coronary arteries (p less than 0.05).
 Relaxations to adenosine and sodium nitroprusside were not significantly different between the two groups.

"Prevalence and characteristics of multiple analgesic drug use in an elderly study group.
 With few exceptions, use of multiple analgesic drugs achieves dubious increases in analgesia while placing elders at increased risk of the many potential adverse effects of analgesic drugs.
 The potential for duplication of analgesic therapy among the elderly is great due to prevalent painful chronic conditions and the variety of prescription and nonprescription analgesic remedies available.
 The prevalence of multiple analgesic product use and patterns of concurrent use of different analgesic categories was investigated in a geographically defined population of persons 65 years of age and older.
 The demographic characteristics of users of multiple analgesic drug products were examined, as were their smoking status, alcohol use, lifetime history rates of major illnesses, physical functioning, pain experiences, memory performance, and depressive symptoms.
 A substantial proportion of analgesic users reported taking multiple products in the preceding 2 weeks (14.4% of female and 10.5% of male analgesic users).
 Men who reported pain in the preceding year were more likely to use multiple analgesic products.
 Women who experienced pain or limited physical functioning, or who had higher depressive symptom scores or a life-time history of ulcers were most likely to use multiple analgesic products.
 Thus, although some users of multiple analgesic products reported significant pain, several other factors were shown to be related to the phenomenon of multiple use.

"Measles incidence, vaccine efficacy, and mortality in two urban African areas with high vaccination coverage.
 Measles incidence, vaccine efficacy, and mortality were examined prospectively in two districts in Bissau where vaccine coverage for children aged 12-23 months was 81% (Bandim 1) and 61% (Bandim 2).
 There was little difference in cumulative measles incidence before 9 months of age (6.1% and 7.6%, respectively).
 Between 9 months and 2 years of age, however, 6.1% contracted measles in Bandim 1 and 13.7% in Bandim 2.
 Even adjusting for vaccination status, incidence was significantly higher in Bandim 2 (relative risk 1.6, P = .04).
 Even though 95% of the children had measles antibodies after vaccination, vaccine efficacy was not more than 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39%-84%) and was unrelated to age at vaccination.
 Unvaccinated children had a mortality hazard ratio of 3.0 compared with vaccinated children (P = .002), indicating a protective efficacy against death of 66% (CI 32%-83%) of measles vaccination.
 These data suggest that it will be necessary to vaccinate before age 9 months to control measles in hyperendemic urban African areas.

"Comparison of propofol and thiopental/halothane for short-duration ENT surgical procedures in children.
 Experiences with propofol in pediatric anesthesia are limited.
 We undertook a study to evaluate the quality of induction and recovery from anesthesia with propofol compared to thiopental/halothane.
 Twenty children received 3 mg.kg-1.min-1 of propofol as a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1 mg.kg-1.min-1 (+/- 10%).
 Twenty children received 5-7 mg/kg of thiopental, and maintenance was provided with halothane (0.5%-1.5%).
 The interval between the end of the administration of propofol or thiopental/halothane and extubation, as well to discharge to the ward, was significantly shorter with propofol (4.4 versus 13.5 min and 7.22 versus 30.4 min, respectively).
 Spontaneous movements and pain on injection were seen significantly more frequently with propofol, whereas laryngospasm and hiccup were only observed with thiopental.
 During the first 6 h after the surgical procedure, analgesics were needed significantly more often in the thiopental group.
 Nausea and vomiting also were observed more frequently in the thiopental group.
 In conclusion, propofol used as a single anesthetic is a satisfactory technique for ENT surgery of short duration in children.

"Noninvasive detection of patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular fibrillation.
 Abnormalities in the fast Fourier transforms of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained during sinus rhythm appear to distinguish patients with ischemic heart disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from those without ventricular tachycardia.
 This study was performed to determine the power of frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of programmed ventricular stimulation.
 Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II).
 Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS).
 Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS).
 In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups.
 Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001).
 Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02).
 Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation.
 These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation.

"Immune responses to allogeneic and xenogeneic implants of collagen and collagen derivatives.
 Whereas xenogeneic collagen has provided a safe and effective biomaterial for numerous medical applications, there are few instances in which data permit the correlation of the immunologic profile of well-defined devices with their clinical sequelae.
 A major exception is the use of injectable bovine dermal collagen for soft-tissue contour correction.
 The low incidence of hypersensitivity has been studied in the context of clinical efficacy and safety with several devices.
 The findings indicate that such immunity usually results in the manifestation of local symptoms of dermal inflammation at sites of treatment that resolve as the implant is resorbed by the host.
 In contrast, more immunogenic hemostatic agents may elicit a more frequent or vigorous immune response that is not clinically visible or relevant in that application.
 Recent experiences with collagen-based devices for the repair and regeneration of bone have also demonstrated that the presence of immunity to their collagenous or non-collagenous components does not necessarily predict adverse clinical sequelae.
 Indeed, numerous specific data indicate that this immunity can exist as an epiphenomenon with no effect on osteogenesis.
 To get a true composite picture of biocompatibility, significant steps must be taken to characterize biomaterials properly and to ensure that immunologic, clinical, histologic, and other pertinent laboratory data are viewed in relation to one another and not in isolation.

"Primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.
 A case of lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is described for the purpose of reviewing the criteria currently used to distinguish this disease from other pleomorphic large-cell malignancies.
 A 76-year-old man with a 3-month history of daily fevers underwent extensive evaluation and exploratory laparotomy, which revealed only two large, separate splenic tumor nodules.
 Postoperatively, the patient remained asymptomatic.
 Histologically, the tumor was composed of giant cells, including both typical Reed-Sternberg forms and mononuclear variants with inflammatory stromal response along its borders.
 Immunoperoxidase showed tumor cells to be strongly reactive for Leu-M1 (CD15), BER-H2 (CD30), Leu-3 (CD4), and T11 (CD2) and weakly reactive for Leu-4 (CD3) but nonreactive for EMA, LCA, lysozyme, Leu-9, Leu-M3, Leu-M5, and immunoglobulin light chains.
 Southern blot analysis revealed an isolated clonal band for kappa light chain only.
 Included in the discussion of this case of primary splenic lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease is a review of clinical, histologic, immunohistochemical, and gene-rearrangement characteristics of what can be defined as lymphocyte-depletion Hodgkin's disease.

"Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XVIII. Reperfusion conditions: attenuation of the regional ischemic effect by temporary total vented bypass before controlled reperfusion.
 This study tests the hypothesis that total vented bypass can attenuate the regional ischemic effect during a defined time interval before controlled blood cardioplegic reperfusion.
 Thirty-three dogs underwent 2 or 4 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and then received a regional blood cardioplegic reperfusate on total vented bypass.
 Cardiopulmonary bypass and reperfusion were started after 2 hours of ischemia in eight dogs, and after 4 hours of ischemia in 25 others.
 Among the 25 dogs, seven had total vented bypass started after the first 2 hours of the 4 hours of regional ischemia.
 Segmental shortening (ultrasonic crystals), tissue water content (wet/dry weight), and histochemical damage (triphenyltetrazolium chloride stain) were assessed 2 hours after reperfusion.
 Dogs reperfused after 2 hours of ischemia recovered 73% +/- 8% of control systolic shortening and sustained only 11% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining.
 Dogs undergoing 4 hours of regional ischemia, but with total vented bypass 2 hours before reperfusion had improved recovery of systolic shortening (49% versus 31%, p less than 0.05), limited epicardial edema (79.6% versus 81.1% water content, p less than 0.05), and reduced histochemical damage (24% versus 39% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining, p less than 0.05).
 These findings imply that institution of total vented bypass during ischemia attenuates the infarct process, increases regional recovery of contractility, limits edema and restricts histochemical damage, and may be a useful adjunct to myocardial salvage when controlled reperfusion can be provided.

"Maternal genomic neutrophil FcRIII deficiency leading to neonatal isoimmune neutropenia.
 The healthy mother of a child with transient immune neutropenia was found to be ""NA-null."" The mother's neutrophils did not react with anti-NA1 and anti-NA2 antibodies (polyclonal human alloantibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies).
 A healthy donor was discovered during routine neutrophil antigen typing whose neutrophils were also ""NA-null."" This NA-phenotype was due to the absence of FcRIII (CD16 antigen) on neutrophils as demonstrated with anti-FcRIII monoclonal antibodies.
 The neutrophils of these two individuals were not able to bind dimeric immunoglobulin G.
 However, their cells had a normal expression of other phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked membrane glycoprotein (CD24, CD67, and CLB gran/5 antigens), ruling out the existence of a PI-linkage defect, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.
 The mother (propsitus) had isoantibodies in her blood against neutrophil-FcRIII without allospecificity, apparently produced during pregnancy and responsible for the neutropenia of her child.
 The expression of FcRIII on natural killer lymphocytes of both individuals was normal.
 FcRIII is encoded by two separate genes, one (FcRIII-1) for the neutrophil-PI-linked receptor, another (FcRIII-2) for the natural killer cell and macrophage-transmembrane receptor.
 By messenger RNA and DNA analysis (with an FcRIII-cDNA probe and restriction endonucleases) the neutrophil-FcRIII deficiency appeared to be due to deletion of the FcRIII-1 gene in both individuals, while the FcRIII-2 gene was normally present.
 The parents of the propositus were found to be heterozygous for this defect.
 Thus, FcRIII-1 gene deficiency of the mother may be a cause of (iso)immune neutropenia of the newborn.
 Whether this deficiency may have other clinical consequences has to be studied.

"An analysis of randomized trials evaluating the effect of cholesterol reduction on total mortality and coronary heart disease incidence.
 The primary aim of this study was to estimate the relation between cholesterol reduction and total mortality and coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence.
 Secondarily, the clinical issues of whether the efficacy of cholesterol lowering is dependent on the treatment modality, presence of CHD at baseline, or the simultaneous introduction of other interventions was explored.
 All randomized clinical intervention trials of cholesterol reduction were used in an overview analysis of total mortality rate and CHD incidence; analysis was performed with weighted linear regression.
 The trials include those that used primary and secondary intervention, diet and drugs, and single or multifactor design.
 Nineteen trials were analyzed for total mortality, and of the 19, 16 were analyzed for CHD incidence rate.
 Net difference in cholesterol change between study groups was used as the independent variable, and the three previously mentioned dichotomous design characteristics were used as additional independent variables.
 For every 1% reduction in cholesterol, an estimated 2.5% reduction in CHD incidence is indicated (95% CL: 1.1, 3.9).
 With regard to CHD drug trials tended toward better efficiency in cholesterol lowering than did dietary trials.
 With regard to total mortality, this efficiency was higher in secondary than in primary preventive trials.
 The efficiency was also somewhat dependent on the baseline cholesterol level.
 This study shows that cholesterol reduction is effective in lowering CHD incidence, but cholesterol reduction must be at least 8-9% to be effective in lowering total mortality.

"A profile of alcohol and prescription drug abuse in a high-risk community-based elderly population.
 Substance abuse among the elderly is relatively common but often remains undetected or ignored by health and social workers.
 Psychosocial and health factors related to the aging process are the major contributors to alcoholism and other drug abuse.
 It is estimated that between two and ten percent of individuals over the age of 60 suffer from alcoholism.
 This article profiles alcohol and prescription drug abuse among the geriatric clientele of Elderly Services of Spokane (ESS), a division of the Spokane (Washington) Community Mental Health Center.
 In addition to traditional channels, ESS uses a unique gatekeeper network to identify high-risk, community-based elderly.
 Elderly persons referred by gatekeepers are regarded as ""hidden"" elderly and at highest risk; notably, 37 percent of ESS clients are referred via this mechanism.
 Case management records of 1668 ESS clients were reviewed for a history of alcoholism, and a total of 161 persons (9.6 percent) were diagnosed with either primary or secondary alcohol abuse.
 Fifty subjects (about five percent of the average active ESS caseload) were referred for prescription drug abuse.
 Misused prescription drug classes were sedative-hypnotics, antianxiety agents, and analgesics.
 Diazepam, codeine, meprobamate, and flurazepam were the top four agents, and 92 percent of the subjects were found to have a duration of prescription drug abuse in excess of five years.
 A 60 percent correlation between prescription drug abuse and previous or active alcoholism was found.
 Additional characteristics of the geriatric study population are discussed in detail, including specific psychosocial factors, source of referral, age, gender, living situation, marital status, psychiatric history, and presence of polypharmacy.

"Electrocardiographic ambulatory monitoring with a real-time analysis system.
 The analysis of records collected during long-term ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has traditionally involved the review of massive data, either manually or with the aid of interactive scanning computers.
 Many factors complicate this analysis, including the use of analog tape for storage of electrocardiographic waveforms, the need to analyze 100,000 waveforms from an average 24-hour study, and the need to deal with an interface that compresses 24 hours of data into as little as 6 minutes on a screen.
 Today, the computer incorporated in the monitor can scrutinize each cardiac cycle in real time.
 The system produces a statistical report based on every heart beat and also performs data reduction and storage of electrocardiograph samples.
 To assess real-time analysis we examined data collected from the Circadian CircaMed ambulatory electrocardiography system.
 We found that it could detect and quantify simple or complex ventricular ectopic beats, brady- or tachyarrhythmic events, and ST-segment deviation.
 One hundred fifty patients 21 to 85 years old with symptoms or clinical finding suggestive of ischemia, cardiac arrhythmia, or conductive defects were referred to our electrocardiography laboratory for ambulatory monitoring.
 The results demonstrate that this system can detect the full range of cardiac disease found with the traditional method.
 Of the 150 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic tests were positive in 93 (62%).
 In addition, we developed a methodology for lead placement when using two bipolar leads, as is typical for ambulatory electrocardiography.
 We present a procedure for determining the optimum lead placement that is based on the patient's history and a 12-lead electrocardiogram.

 The complete nucleotide sequence of an HIV-2 isolate derived from a German AIDS patient with predominantly neurological symptoms is reported.
 The HIV-2BEN sequence is highly divergent from those of previously described HIV-2 and SIV strains.
 Evolutionary tree analysis of eight HIV-2 sequences reveals the existence of three HIV-2 groups.
 HIV-2BEN belongs to a group with two isolates from Ghana and The Gambia.
 Based on a comparison of HIV-2BEN with six HIV-2 isolates, SIVsmm and SIVmac, the variability of the structural env and gag proteins is similar within the HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac and HIV-1 groups.
 In contrast, the regulatory HIV-1 proteins are more highly conserved than those from HIV-2 strains.
 Multiple sequence alignments reveal that some domains of the envelope and regulatory proteins are well conserved among HIV-1, HIV-2/SIVsmm/mac, SIVagm and SIVmnd.

 Patients were grouped according to their M-mode aortic root diameter as measured in the left parasternal position.
 The measured groups ranged from 2.0 to 4.5 cm, grouped at 0.1 cm intervals.
 As the aortic root size enlarged, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly (p less than 0.001; correlation coefficient, r = 0.75).
 At an aortic root size in the ""small normal"" range of 2.0 to 2.4 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation was 0% to 15%.
 In the ""intermediate"" and ""top normal"" ranges of 2.9 to 3.7 cm, the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increased linearly from 15% to 47%.
 With aortic root dilation, the prevalence of aortic root regurgitation was generally more than 50%.
 The severity of aortic regurgitation was semiquantified.
 Aortic root size was not a good indicator for the severity of aortic regurgitation.
 Patients with moderate and severe aortic regurgitation had variable aortic root sizes.
 Throughout the range of aortic root sizes, mild aortic regurgitation predominated.
 We conclude that aortic regurgitation is a common finding in patients with aortic roots that are dilated or are in the ""top normal"" size range, that the prevalence of aortic regurgitation increases linearly with aortic root size, and that aortic root size does not correlate with the severity of aortic regurgitation.

"AZT demonstrates anti-HIV-1 activity in persistently infected cell lines: implications for combination chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
 A sensitive and quantitative focal immunoassay has been used to measure the effects of three different therapeutic agents on tissue culture cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 The effects of the drugs were studied on both acutely and persistently infected CD4+ cell lines.
 The three agents, azidothymidine (AZT), interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and an anti-HIV envelope antibody coupled to ricin A chain, were tested alone and in combination.
 AZT was found to have its greatest effect during early stages of the infection, but also had an action on persistently infected T cell lines.
 The effect of AZT on persistently infected cells was seen within 24 h, increased with extended exposure to the drug, and persisted after its removal.
 IFN-alpha had variable effects on acutely infected cells but suppressed chronic infection.
 Combinations of the therapeutic agents were studied.
 Using a model that allowed for treatment during both acute and persistent stages of infection, the most effective combination in suppressing HIV infection was the continual use of both AZT and IFN-alpha at the highest tolerable doses.
 Knowledge of the efficacy of AZT on persistently infected cells will allow for the most effective design of clinical protocols.

"Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with Pneumocystis carinii. Ultrastructural identification in bronchoalveolar lavage in AIDS and immunocompromised non-AIDS patients.
 Pneumocystis carinii (PC) has been recognized as frequently responsible for most opportunistic pulmonary infections occurring in immunocompromised AIDS and non-AIDS patients.
 Moreover, these patients can be considered at risk for secondary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.
 Therefore, we have investigated the occurrence of associated secondary alveolar proteinosis and PC pneumonitis in AIDS and non-AIDS immunocompromised patients.
 In a series of 26 bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) in patients with PC pneumonitis (19 AIDS and seven non-AIDS patients), we observed on light microscopy, in addition to the honeycombed material, areas of an extracellular material that had a different pattern which was suggestive of that described in alveolar proteinosis.
 A systematic ultrastructural study of these 26 BAL fluid samples demonstrated in each of them an accumulation of phospholipid surfactantlike extracellular material mixed or not with the PC cysts.
 In nine cases, the observation of lipoproteinaceous material on light microscopy and abundant phospholipid material with myelinlike and myelin tubular laminated structures on electron microscopy was highly suggestive of an associated pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).
 Such an accumulation of extracellular material was not observed in the 11 BAL fluid samples collected in immunocompromised patients (seven AIDS and four non-AIDS patients) without PC pneumonitis.
 These findings demonstrated a particular frequency of associated PAP with PC pneumonitis.
 These results raise important questions concerning (1) the consequence of such an alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous material on the clinical status and prognosis of the pneumonitis, and (2) the mechanisms responsible for this accumulation.

"Long-term fate of the vascularized iliac crest bone graft for mandibular reconstruction.
 Vascularized bone grafts, such as the iliac crest, have become a major tool for mandibular reconstruction.
 Due to the growing trend toward immediate bone replacement followed by implant osseointegration and dental rehabilitation, further understanding of the long-term characteristics of these grafts is essential.
 Early postoperative bone scans demonstrate increased activity within the vascularized graft relative to surrounding bone.
 This study addressed the use of bone SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) scintigraphy as a long-term method of evaluating the integrity of vascularized bone grafts.

"Diastrophic dysplasia gene maps to the distal long arm of chromosome 5.
 We have used polymorphic DNA markers to map the gene for a clinically well-characterized form of osteochondrodysplasia, diastrophic dysplasia (DD), an autosomal recessive disorder of unknown pathogenesis.
 Linkage was analyzed in 13 families with two or three affected sibs comprising a total of 84 individuals.
 Positive two-point logarithm-of-odds (lod) scores were obtained between the DD locus and three polymorphic markers on chromosome 5.
 The highest pairwise lod score estimate of 7.37 with zero recombination to locus D5S72 suggests very tight linkage.
 There was no evidence of heterogeneity.
 Multipoint linkage analysis against the published order of the three loci gave the result centromere-D5S84-(DD, D5S72)-D5S61-terminus with a four-point lod score of 9.11.
 The present findings place the DD locus distal to the gene for adenomatous polyposis coli on the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 5.
 Our results provide a basis for refining the map position of the DD locus followed by physical localization, isolation, and characterization of the gene.

"Immediate skin test reactivity to Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts.
 In an effort to determine whether recently introduced Food and Drug Administration-approved standardized extracts produce clinically appropriate responses in a population, 200 subjects were skin prick tested (SPT).
 Thirteen extracts (10 pollens, two house dust (HD) mites and cat) were tested in three groups of subjects, 50 with a history of asthma or allergic rhinitis (AL), 50 without asthma or perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis but with a positive immediate family history for these conditions (FAL), and 100 subjects without a personal or family history for these conditions (NAL).
 An SPT mean wheal diameter greater than or equal to 3 mm was considered positive.
 Ninety percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 82% to 98%) of AL subjects had at least one positive SPT.
 Forty-six percent of FAL subjects (95% CI, 30% to 58%) and 29% of NAL subjects (95% CI, 20% to 38%) had at least one positive SPT.
 More FAL than NAL subjects had at least one SPT (p less than 0.05), and FAL subjects had more positive SPTs than NAL subjects (p less than 0.05), further supporting the genetic regulation of allergen-specific IgE production.
 Of the five AL subjects with no SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm, three subjects were available for intradermal tests.
 Thirteen nonstandardized allergens similar to allergens used for SPT were applied intradermally in each of these three subjects and were all negative.
 Compared with history, an SPT wheal greater than or equal to 3 mm to cat produced a sensitivity of 0.90, a specificity of 0.90, and diagnostic accuracy of 0.90.
 Tenfold dilutions of pollens and cat reduced sensitivity without significantly improving specificity.

"Prostatic-type epithelium in urinary bladder. Clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical study.
 Six cases of urinary bladder mucosa with prostate-type epithelium were studied clinically, morphologically, and immunohistochemically.
 All patients were male with an average age of fifty-three years; most presented with painless hematuria.
 Histologically, two types of lesions were observed, the polypoid located in various sites of the bladder wall and the flat lesion found in the bladder neck.
 Both lesions shared in common a prostatic-type and transitional surface epithelium while prostatic-type glands were prominent in the polypoid lesion.
 The prostatic-type epithelium was confirmed immunohistochemically by detection of prostatic specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase.
 Based on specific findings we considered the metaplasia as the most reliable histogenetic aspect.

"Manual stretch: effect on finger movement control and force control in stroke subjects with spastic extrinsic finger flexor muscles.
 This study evaluated the effects of manual stretch of extrinsic finger flexor muscles on finger extension movement control and force control in 16 spastic hemiparetic subjects.
 These subjects were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group.
 A group of able-bodied subjects also participated.
 A joint-movement tracking test (JMTT) quantified control of active finger extension movement at the metacarpophalangeal joint of the index finger within the available range of active movement, and a force tracking test (FTT) quantified control of isometric finger extension force at the same joint within the subject's available force range.
 Electromyographic activity was monitored in the extensor digitorum and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles during both tracking tests.
 Manual stretch was applied to the extrinsic finger flexor muscles of the experimental group between the pretest and posttest tracking tests.
 The JMTT performances of both control (p less than .025) and experimental (p less than .05) groups were significantly subnormal on the pretest as were FTT performances of controls (p less than .01) and study subjects (p less than .03).
 The JMTT improvement on posttest was significantly greater (p less than .05) in subjects than in controls.
 However, the change in FTT performance was not significantly different between the two groups.
 Manual stretch treatment, properly applied to extrinsic finger flexor muscles, is an effective method of temporarily improving the control of finger extension movement in spastic hemiparetic subjects.

"Hydraulic conductivity of canine parietal pleura in vivo.
 The hydraulic conductivity (Lp) of the parietal pleura was measured in vivo in spontaneously breathing anesthetized dogs in either the supine (n = 8) or the prone (n = 7) position and in an excised portion of the chest wall in which the pleura and its adjacent tissue were intact (n = 3).
 A capsule was glued to the exposed parietal pleura after the intercostal muscles were removed.
 The capsule was filled with either autologous plasma or isotonic saline.
 Transpleural fluid flow (V) was measured at several transpleural hydrostatic pressures (delta P) from the rate of meniscus movement within a graduated pipette connected to the capsule.
 Delta P was defined as the measured difference between capsule and pleural liquid pressures.
 The Lp of the parietal pleura was calculated from the slope of the line relating V to delta P by use of linear regression analysis.
 Lp in vivo averaged 1.36 X 10(-3) +/- 0.45 X 10(-3) (SD) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2, regardless of whether the capsule was filled with plasma or saline and irrespective of body position.
 This value was not significantly different from that measured in the excised chest wall preparation (1.43 X 10(-3) +/- 1.1 X 10(-3) ml.h-1.cmH2O-1.cm-2).
 The parietal pleura offers little resistance to transpleural protein movement, because there was no observed difference between plasma and saline.
 We conclude that because the Lp for intact parietal pleura and extrapleural interstitium is approximately 100 times smaller than that previously measured in isolated stripped pleural preparations, removal of parietal pleural results in a damaged preparation.

"Ventricular stroke work loss: validation of a method of quantifying the severity of aortic stenosis and derivation of an orifice formula 
 Because aortic stenosis results in the loss of left ventricular stroke work (due to resistance to flow through the valve and turbulence in the aorta), the percentage of stroke work that is lost may reflect the severity of stenosis.
 This index can be calculated from pressure data alone.
 The relation between percent stroke work loss and anatomic aortic valve orifice area (measured by planimetry from videotape) was investigated in a pulsatile flow model.
 Thirteen valves were studied (nine human aortic valves obtained at necropsy and four bioprosthetic valves) at stroke volumes of 40 to 100 ml, giving 57 data points.
 Valve area ranged from 0.3 to 2.8 cm2 and mean systolic pressure gradient from 3 to 84 mm Hg.
 Percent stroke work loss, calculated as mean systolic pressure gradient divided by mean ventricular systolic pressure x 100%, ranged from 7 to 68%.
 It was closely related to anatomic orifice area with an inverse exponential relation and was not significantly related to flow (r = -0.15).
 An orifice formula was derived that predicted anatomic orifice area with a 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.5 cm2 (orifice area [cm2] = 4.82 [2.39 x log percent stroke work loss], r = -0.94, SEE = 0.029).
 These results support the clinical use of percent stroke work loss as an easily obtained index of the severity of aortic stenosis.

"Management of gastroenteritis.
 Childhood gastroenteritis remains a common reason for admission to British paediatric units, although the severity of the disease appears to be diminishing in recent years.
 We studied 215 infants and children with gastroenteritis admitted consecutively to four paediatric units in South Wales in order to determine the severity of the disease, the organisms isolated, the frequency of complications, and the adequacy of management before admission.
 Stool pathogens were isolated in 125 (58%) patients (viruses in 65, bacteria in 30, and protozoa in 19, with multiple infection found in 11).
 There was a low incidence of morbidity and complications, but prolonged diarrhoea (postenteritis syndrome) was present in 24 (11%) cases and 77 (36%) had received inappropriate treatment before admission.
 Contemporary gastroenteritis is thus a relatively mild disease in the acute phase, but management before admission to hospital is often inadequate, and prolonged diarrhoea may be a feature in a considerable number of cases.

 We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC.
 Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases.
 Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated.
 However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status.

"Cardiac rhythm disturbances early after orthotopic heart transplantation: prevalence and clinical importance of the observed abnormalities.
 To precisely define the incidence, type and consequences of cardiac arrhythmias early after heart transplantation, 25 cardiac transplant recipients were monitored continuously for 728 days from the day of surgery to discharge or death.
 A subset of 15 patients had sinus node function studies with overdrive suppression performed weekly at the time of endomyocardial biopsy.
 Results revealed sinus bradycardia in 10 patients (40%) and junctional bradycardia in 6 (24%).
 Supraventricular tachycardia in the form of atrial tachycardia, atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter occurred in 11 patients (44%).
 Ventricular tachycardia occurred in 15 patients (60%) and was nonsustained in all.
 Cardiac pacing for 1,403 h was used in nine patients with a pulse rate less than 50 beats/min; seven recovered and permanent pacing was instituted in two.
 In the subgroup that had sinus node function studies, seven patients were identified with clinical bradyarrhythmia; each had abnormal sinus node recovery time (greater than 1,400 ms) and abnormal corrected sinus node recovery time (greater than 525 ms) in at least one study.
 These seven patients also had a significantly prolonged ischemic time (236 +/- 26 versus 159 +/- 68 min, p less than 0.01).
 In conclusion, cardiac arrhythmias, particularly ventricular tachycardia and bradyarrhythmia, occur more commonly early after orthotopic heart transplantation than has previously been reported.
 Sinus node dysfunction due to prolonged organ ischemic time, antiarrhythmic drug use or surgical trauma, alone or in combination, may contribute to these arrhythmias.

"Modeling the impact of breast-feeding by HIV-infected women on child survival [published erratum appears in Am J Public Health 1991 May;81(5):658-9]
 This study models the survival outcomes of children born to HIV-infected (human immunodeficiency virus) women who are breast-fed, bottle-fed, and wet-nursed.
 It is estimated that, given the relative risk of alternatives to maternal milk in developing countries, the probability of HIV transmission via breast milk would need to be at least .12 in a community with an under five child mortality rate from non-HIV causes of 100/1000 live births and at least .27 in a community with a rate of 200/1000 before alternative feeding practices should be recommended even to the known HIV-infected mother who has an available feeding alternative with a relative risk of 2:1.
 While such a low relative risk may be achievable with wet nursing, most studies report a relative risk of at least 3:1 for bottle feeding.
 A sensitivity analysis is conducted around the relative risk of child mortality from non-HIV causes associated with different feeding practices.
 While the critical transmission rate does not vary significantly with a rate of false positives as high as 20 percent on the HIV screening test, the critical transmission rate is very sensitive to the availability of HIV screening.
 In communities where the HIV prevalence rate among mothers reaches 40 percent, breast-feeding should still be recommended in the absence of HIV screening unless HIV transmission via breast milk surpasses 30 percent.

"Impaired growth hormone (GH) response to pyridostigmine in type 1 diabetic patients with exaggerated GH-releasing hormone-stimulated GH secretion.
 In the present study we investigated the effects of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor pyridostigmine (PD), which is hypothesized to decrease hypothalamic somatostatin tone, alone and in association with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) on GH secretion in 18 type 1 diabetic patients and 12 normal subjects using a randomized double blind placebo-controlled protocol.
 All subjects received either 120 mg oral PD or placebo 60 min before iv injection of either human GHRH-(1-29) NH2 (100 micrograms) or sterile water (2 mL).
 In normal subjects both PD alone and GHRH alone caused a significant increase in GH.
 PD and GHRH acted in a synergistic fashion when combined.
 In diabetic patients the GH response to GHRH was variable.
 To segregate the responses, the ratio between the GH increase after GHRH plus PD and after GHRH alone was calculated for each subject.
 In 10 diabetic patients (group A) the ratio was lower than 2 SD (P less than 0.05) from the mean response of normal subjects.
 These patients showed an exaggerated GH increase after GHRH and a lower GH increase after PD with respect to normal subjects.
 Eight diabetic patients (group B) showed a ratio similar to that in normal subjects and similar GH responses to the stimuli.
 No significant differences were found between groups A and B with respect to age, body mass index, and blood glucose levels.
 Duration of diabetes was longer and basal GH levels were higher in group A.
 Hemoglobin-A1c was higher in group A, but of only borderline statistical significance (P = 0.052).
 Our data demonstrate that in diabetic patients with exaggerated GH responses to GHRH an increase in cholinergic tone does not affect GH secretion.
 These data suggest that in some type 1 diabetic patients an altered somatostatinergic control of GH secretion may contribute to their abnormal GH response to GHRH.

"Pathogenesis of biliary sludge.
 The increasing application of ultrasonography in biliary tract disease had led to more frequent recognition of an old disorder--""biliary sludge."" Sludge is detected on ultrasound as low-amplitude echoes without acoustic shadowing.
 It layers in the most dependent part of the gallbladder and shifts with positioning.
 Particulate matter in bile, such as cholesterol monohydrate crystals, has been shown to be echogenic.
 Agglomeration of these crystals in biles with high mucus content accounts for the layering and the characteristic appearance of the movement of sludge with alteration in patient position.
 Within the gallbladder, the stability of the vesicular form of cholesterol and protein-lipid interactions are important determinants of cholesterol precipitation.
 In mixed and pigment gallstones, the equilibrium between ionized and unionized calcium and the hydrolysis of conjugated bilirubin are also important factors.
 Although the risk factors contributing to the formation of gallbladder sludge have not been critically examined, it is now known that in some instances sludge can produce biliary pain and can be associated with acalculous cholecystitis, recurrent pancreatitis and, ultimately, the formation of gallstones.
 A better appreciation of the pathogenesis of sludge formation can help in the understanding of the genesis of gallstones and also perhaps in understanding other documented but poorly understood biliary and pancreatic disorders.

"The alien hand sign. Localization, lateralization and recovery.
 The alien hand sign was first described by Brion and Jedynak as a ""feeling of estrangement between the patient and one of his hands."" The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a ""magnetic apraxia"" associated with frontal lobe damage.
 Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient.
 The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent.
 They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's ""extravolitional"" activity.
 The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed ""self-restriction."" In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand.
 In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand.
 Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke.
 These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the ""dual premotoer systems hypothesis,"" an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties.
 It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere.
 The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere.
 Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior.
 This observation may be important in understanding mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke.

"Electrotonic influences on action potentials from isolated ventricular cells.
 This work combines a theoretical study of electrical interactions between two excitable heart cells, using a variable coupling resistance, with experimental studies on isolated rabbit ventricular cells coupled with a variable coupling resistance to a passive resistance and capacitance circuit.
 The theoretical results show that the response of an isolated cell to an increased frequency of stimulation is strongly altered by the presence of a coupling resistance to another cell.
 As the coupling resistance gradually is decreased, the stimulated cell becomes able to respond successfully to more rapid stimulation, and then, at levels of coupling resistance that allow conduction between the two cells, the coupled pair of cells exhibits arrhythmic interactions not predicted by the intrinsic properties of either cell.
 The experimental results show that the isolated rabbit ventricular cell is extremely sensitive to even a very small electrical load, with shortening of the action potential by 50% with electrical coupling to a model cell (of similar input resistance and capacitance to the ventricular cell) as high as 1,000 M omega, even though the action potential amplitude and current threshold are very insensitive to the electrical load.

"Occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease among German employees.
 Previous reports have shown that both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis affect people in white collar occupations associated with higher income and higher social class more frequently than other groups in the population.
 This study sought to carry these analyses one step further and investigate the distribution of inflammatory bowel disease by individual occupations.
 The German social security statistics for 'rehabilitation' were used to assess the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.
 From 1982 to 1988, a total of 12,014 people were granted rehabilitation as a result of inflammatory bowel disease.
 Low male prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease was found among bricklayers, road construction workers, unskilled workers in brick and stone, unskilled labourers, and security personnel.
 Low rates were found among women employed in cleaning and maintenance, and in those without occupation.
 In contrast, a high male prevalence was found among instrument makers, electricians, bakers, and technical assistants.
 Among female employees, inflammatory bowel disease was significantly associated with sales representatives, office workers, health occupations, and hairdressers.
 These associations were found in the complete data for 1982-8 as well as in the separate data for the two half periods 1982-5 and 1986-8.
 Highly significant correlations between the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were found among both male and female employees.
 It seems that occupations involving work in the open air and physical exercise are protective, while being exposed to air conditioned artificial working conditions or extended and irregular shift working confer a risk of contracting inflammatory bowel disease.

 Between 1976 and 1985, 391 patients (202 premenopausal, 189 postmenopausal) with operable breast cancer and positive axillary lymph nodes were randomized after total mastectomy and axillary clearance to receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) (n = 193) or no adjuvant therapy (n = 198).
 After a median follow-up of 8 years, both relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) were significantly prolonged in premenopausal patients receiving CMF (RFS, P less than .001; S, P = .003).
 Treatment with CMF resulted in a significant improvement in RFS in premenopausal patients both with steroid receptor-positive and steroid receptor-negative tumors and also in subgroups of premenopausal patients defined by the number of axillary nodes involved.
 Premenopausal patients who developed permanent amenorrhea following CMF had a significantly better RFS than those who continued to menstruate.
 Induction of amenorrhea following CMF was related to age, with almost all patients over 40 years becoming amenorrheic.
 For patients less than or equal to 40 years, development of amenorrhea following CMF did not influence outcome.
 No difference was detected between control and CMF groups (RFS, P = .9; S, P = .9) in postmenopausal patients nor in any subgroup of these patients.
 The results of this trial of the efficacy of CMF for improving RFS and S have strengthened with longer follow-up.

 Reocclusions were observed in six of the patients with malignant obstructions (11%) (observation period, 1-10 months; mean, 4.5 months) and in two of the patients with benign stenoses (25%) (observation period, 3-21 months; mean, 9 months).
 The higher reocclusion rate of benign obstructions must be interpreted with care because of the small number of patients.
 From their preliminary experience, the authors conclude that expandable metal endoprostheses offer patency rates equal to those of plastic stents.
 The implantation trauma is reduced due to the small 7-F introducing catheter system.

"Pleuropulmonary morbidity: internal thoracic artery versus saphenous vein graft.
 Although use of the internal thoracic artery (ITA) for coronary artery bypass grafting results in superior graft patency and improved patient survival, our initial clinical observations suggested an increased incidence of pleuropulmonary morbidity with its use.
 One hundred consecutive patients with left ITA grafts were studied prospectively and compared with a consecutive retrospective group of 100 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous vein grafts only.
 Preoperative, postoperative day (POD) 2, POD 6, and postoperative week 8 chest roentgenograms were analyzed for atelectasis and effusion.
 Postoperative left lower lobe atelectasis was common in both groups on both POD 2 (saphenous vein, 43%, versus ITA, 53%; not significant) and POD 6 (saphenous vein, 40%, versus ITA, 41%; not significant).
 There was a significantly higher incidence of pleural effusion on POD 6 in the ITA group (84% versus 47%; p less than 0.05) but most of these were small.
 There was more chest tube drainage (1,413 versus 1,028 mL; p less than 0.01) and a greater need for secondary thoracostomy or thoracentesis (4% versus 0%) in the ITA group.
 The left pleural space was opened in 67 of the 100 ITA patients but pleurotomy did not appear to influence postoperative morbidity.
 We conclude that use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary artery bypass grafting results in a small but significant increase in pleuropulmonary morbidity.

"Crystalluria, medullary matrix crystal deposits and bladder calculi associated with an acutely induced renal papillary necrosis.
 A single (100 mg/kg) intraperitoneal dose of 2-bromoethanamine hydrobromide induced renal papillary necrosis (RPN) acutely in rodents and caused a transient crystalluria between 4 and 8 h after dosing.
 These crystals comprised struvite or magnesium ammonium phosphate (MAP) as assessed by shape, solubility, infra-red spectrum and X-ray microprobe analysis.
 Acid-soluble, bi-refringent crystals were also present within the renal medullary matrix during the same time period as the crystalluria.
 The presence of the MAP was associated with loss of the anionic renal medullary mucopolysaccharides staining.
 A total of 5/64 rats with a 2-bromoethanamine-induced renal papillary necrosis and monitored for up to 160 days had bladder calculi that were predominantly MAP.
 These data suggest that medullary mucopolysaccharide matrix disruption associated with RPN leads to a release of previously bound cations, super-saturation and the nucleation of crystalline MAP.
 These processes could also be implicated in the formation of MAP bladder calculi.

"Hiccups and breathing in human fetuses.
 Serial recording in 45 low risk fetuses throughout the second and third trimesters showed that hiccups were the predominant diaphragmatic movement before 26 weeks' gestational age and that there was a significant negative correlation with gestational age.
 There was a pronounced reduction between 24 and 26 weeks, which was the result of a decrease in the number of episodes of hiccups rather than a change in the duration of episodes.
 In contrast, fetal breathing was positively correlated with gestational age, the greatest increase in breathing occurring between 26 and 32 weeks' gestation.
 This was the result of both an increase in the number and duration of episodes.
 From the time that rest-activity cycles of behaviour could be determined in recordings, both breathing and hiccups were dependent on behavioural state or cycle, occurring predominantly during active episodes.
 This association between quiet and active behaviour and breathing did not alter with increasing gestational age, and the variables in fetal behavioural state became increasingly closely linked.
 The importance of prolonged and repeated recording, and also the need to take account of other variables in fetal behaviour, before any sinister conclusions can be drawn about the absence of fetal breathing is emphasised.

"Thyroid hormones influences sex steroid binding protein levels in infancy: study in congenital hypothyroidism.
 In order to test the hypothesis of a role of thyroid hormones on the circulating levels of sex steroid binding protein (SHBG) in children, SHBG levels were determined in 15 infants with congenital hypothyroidism at diagnosis and during the first 18 months of T4 therapy and in a separate group of 13 children with congenital hypothyroidism (7.1 +/- 0.5 yr, mean +/- SD), treated before 1 month of age, both during adequate L-T4 therapy and 4 weeks after withdrawing therapy.
 SHBG levels were significantly lower in hypothyroid infants than in controls (48.2 +/- 6.5 vs.
 77.8 +/- 7.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.01), and significantly lower in infants with athyreosis compared to those with ectopic or eutopic glands (P less than 0.05).
 In patients with low values at diagnosis, SHBG increased rapidly and remained normal during LT4 therapy.
 After 1.5-18 months of treatment, a positive correlation (P less than 0.01) was found between SHBG, FT4, and FT3 levels.
 In older hypothyroid children, 4 weeks after withdrawal of therapy a significant (P less than 0.05) decrease in SHBG concentrations was observed.
 Analysis of these results as well as previous reports in adults, indicates that thyroid hormones influence SHBG concentrations in infants and children.
 This study also indicates that thyroid hormones may play a role in the physiological postnatal increase of SHBG.

"Epithelial rests' function in replantation: is splinting necessary in replantation?
 The problem of resorption during replantation in relationship to the epithelial rests and a lack of splinting was studied.
 Ten mongrel dogs were used.
 Two dogs served as control subjects, while eight had their mandibular incisors intentionally replanted and studied histologically.
 It was observed that where rests of Malassez were present we did not see resorption, and the lack of splinting did not result in resorption or loss of teeth.
 It appears we can stain epithelial rests of Malassez with immunofluorescent antibodies and use this technique for further study of this tissue.

"Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in urinary diversion with urea-splitting urinary tract infection.
 We present two cases of hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to urea-splitting urinary tract infection with urinary diversion.
 One patient had a ureterosigmoidostomy, the other an ileal loop diversion.
 Neither patient had significant underlying liver disease, but both had considerable muscle atrophy that may have predisposed them to develop hyperammonemia.
 Medical therapy did not provide long-term control of symptoms.
 In both cases, hyperammonemic encephalopathy resolved after revision of their urinary diversions.
 The probable mechanism of the metabolic derangements produced by urea-splitting urinary tract infections is reviewed.
 We suggest that patients with urinary diversion who develop hyperammonemic encephalopathy secondary to a urea-splitting urinary tract infection be treated with surgical revision of the urinary system to improve drainage and decrease bowel contact time.

"Prevention of infection in a porous tracheal prosthesis by omental wrapping.
 The ideal tracheal prosthesis has to permit complete incorporation by epithelialization of the luminal surface.
 This is not possible with the currently available impermeable solid silicone tube.
 The authors developed a reinforced, porous polyurethane tubular prosthesis which has the potential for complete incorporation.
 However, because these prostheses are implanted in a contamined area such as the airway, they all become infected.
 In order to prevent infection, the authors evaluated the effect of omental wrapping in guinea pigs.
 The authors' tubular prosthesis was implanted subcutaneously in the abdominal area with the ends open to the air.
 Ten prostheses were wrapped with omentum and 10 prostheses were not.
 In 4 weeks, all control prostheses were infected and marsupialized.
 All the wrapped prostheses remained in place and were macroscopically not infected.
 Microscopically, all wrapped prostheses were well vascularized and were incorporated by granulation tissue, which did not occur in the prostheses of the control group.
 From these results the authors conclude that omental wrapping would be an effective way to prevent infection of porous tracheal prostheses in an open-to-the-air situation, and allow rapid tissue ingrowth and incorporation in the host.

"An anonymous seroprevalence survey of HIV infection among pregnant women in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory 
 We performed an anonymous seroprevalence survey of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 infection through HIV antibody testing of blood samples from 22,512 women aged 15 to 44 years receiving prenatal care in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory from Mar.
 15 to Sept.
 30, 1989.
 Of the samples six were confirmed to be HIV positive; this yielded a crude overall seroprevalence rate of 2.7 per 10,000 pregnant women (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0 to 5.8).
 All of the positive samples were from women 20 to 29 years of age; four were from Vancouver, one was from Victoria, and one was from elsewhere.
 The highest seroprevalence rates were among women aged 15 to 29 years in Vancouver and Victoria (7.2 and 9.4 per 10,000 pregnant women respectively).
 Thus, 1 in 1300 pregnant women in that age group in the metropolitan areas of British Columbia was HIV positive.
 Application of seroprevalence rates to the total female population in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory revealed that as many as 401 women had HIV infection in 1989.
 Our estimates likely represent the minimum.
 As a subset of women of childbearing age pregnant women are likely at lowest risk of HIV infection, and so the true number of women 15 to 44 years of age with HIV infection is probably several times higher.
 Our study has provided a baseline assessment and will be repeated annually to analyse trends in HIV seroprevalence among pregnant women in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory.

"Folate status of adolescents: effects of folic acid supplementation.
 This study was designed to determine the folate status of an adolescent population and to demonstrate the effect of folic acid supplementation on subjects with low folate status.
 In phase one, folate status was evaluated in a biracial sample of 164 adolescents 12 to 15 years old.
 Socioeconomic, demographic, anthropometric, and 7-day food record data were collected, and serum and erythrocyte folate levels were determined.
 Thirty-five adolescents considered to have had low folate status 6 months earlier participated in phase two, a 2-month supplementation period and reevaluation.
 No racial differences were observed in folate status, as indicated by amount of folate in the blood and diet.
 Boys had significantly (p less than .05) higher folate levels in serum and erythrocytes than did girls.
 Thirteen percent of the boys and 40% of the girls were folate deficient as judged by amount of erythrocyte folate less than 317 nmol/L (140 ng/mL).
 The folate-deficient subjects had significantly (p less than .05) lower values of hemoglobin than did the normal subjects.
 Seventeen percent of the boys and 42% of the girls had folate intakes below the recommended dietary allowance for folate.
 Supplementation of 400 micrograms folic acid daily for 2 months resulted in significant (P less than .05) increases in serum folate, erythrocyte folate, and hemoglobin values and a decrease in mean corpuscular volume.
 Evidence of high prevalence of low folate status, positive relationship between erythrocyte folate and hemoglobin, and responses of hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume to the supplement indicated that folate consumption may not be optimal in some groups of adolescents, especially in girls.

"Restenosis after directional coronary atherectomy: differences between primary atheromatous and restenosis lesions and influence of subintimal tissue resection.
 Rates of restenosis were evaluated in 70 patients (74 lesions) after successful directional coronary atherectomy.
 The extent of vascular tissue resection was correlated with restenosis rates for coronary (n = 59) and vein bypass graft (n = 15) lesions.
 After 6 months, the overall restenosis rate was 50% (37 of 74 lesions); it was 42% (15 of 36 lesions) when intima alone was resected, 50% (7 of 14 lesions) when media was resected and 63% (15 of 24 lesions) when adventitia was resected.
 Subintimal tissue resection increased the restenosis rate for vein grafts (43% with intimal resection versus 100% with subintimal resection, p = 0.01) but not for coronary arteries (50% versus 48%).
 There was no overall difference in restenosis rates after atherectomy between primary lesions and restenosis lesions that occurred after balloon angioplasty (46% versus 54%).
 Among postballoon angioplasty restenosis lesions, a higher rate of restenosis after atherectomy was found with subintimal than with intimal resection (78% versus 32%, p = 0.01).
 Tissues from patients undergoing a second atherectomy for restenosis after initial atherectomy (n = 8) demonstrated neointimal hyperplasia that appeared histologically identical to restenotic tissue developing after balloon angioplasty (n = 37).
 These data suggest that the cellular response to directional coronary atherectomy is characterized by neointimal proliferation similar to that which may develop after balloon angioplasty.
 The extent of fibrous hyperplasia appears to be related to the depth of tissue resection in vein graft lesions and coronary artery restenosis lesions that occur after balloon angioplasty but not in primary atheromatous coronary artery lesions.

"Use of biological glue to control pulmonary air leaks.
 Biological glue is a natural adhesive generated by the interaction between fibrinogen (pre-glue) and thrombin to produce fibrin.
 The pre-glue is prepared from a single donor (to avoid the problems of pooled plasma) and stored as cryoprecipitate.
 Before being used it is thawed, dissolved in saline, and activated into an adhesive by the addition of topical thrombin.
 Biological glue was used prophylactically to prevent air leaks from bronchial suture lines and raw lung surfaces after pulmonary resections in six patients.
 In addition two new methods of using biological glue have been developed for the control of persisting air leaks.
 In selective intrabronchial tamponade the glue is instilled into the bronchial tree through a flexible bronchoscope, and in therapeutic pleurodesis it is instilled into the pleural cavity through a chest drainage tube.
 The air leaks were resolved in all cases.
 Seven procedures using selective intrabronchial tamponade were carried out in six patients.
 Four were immediately successful but three were not and required further interventions.
 Therapeutic pleurodesis alone was successfully carried out in one patient and as an adjunct to selective intrabronchial tamponade on two occasions.
 A thoracotomy was eventually needed in one of the seven patients.

"Photodynamic therapy in the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
 Photodynamic therapy is an experimental modality for tumor treatment based on the combined action of the tumor-localizing agent, ie, hematoporphyrin derivative, and red light.
 From 1985 through 1989, 26 patients were treated using hematoporphyrin-derived drugs and 630-nm light delivered by a tunable dye laser.
 All patients had biopsy-proved squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and they had either failed the traditional treatment modalities or refused conventional therapies.
 Histological complete responses were achieved in 20 (77%) of 26 patients and partial responses in 5 (19%) of 26 patients for periods up to 48 months.
 Only minimal toxic reaction was noted in the group.
 As a guide to treatment planning for a patient group with large tumors, we used an optical dosimetry model based on tissue optics.
 The rate of complete responses to this treatment was 8 (73%) of 11.
 Our data indicate that photodynamic therapy is capable of inducing significant clinical and histological responses in the majority of those treated, and in some patients a prolonged response is produced.
 In certain select head and neck malignancies, photodynamic therapy has an important role as a treatment modality.

 Five-year survival data were obtained in 97 percent or 1105 of 1140 new patients with histologically confirmed colorectal adenocarcinoma during a 12-month period in 1981 and 1982, as part of a large comprehensive population-based study of colorectal cancer incidence, etiology, and survival, The Melbourne Colorectal Cancer Study.
 Fifteen percent of patients were Dukes' A stage, 32 percent were Dukes' B, 25 percent were Dukes' C, and 29 percent were Dukes' D.
 At five years after diagnosis, the observed survival rate was 36 percent and the adjusted rate was 42 percent.
 Dukes' staging was a highly discriminating factor in survival (P less than 0.001).
 Survival rates were better in women than in men and better for patients with colon cancer than for patients with rectal cancer.
 Survival by Dukes' staging was not affected by colon subsite or by the tumor being the first and single tumor, metachronous tumor, or synchronous tumor.
 The survival of younger patients was better for Dukes' stages A, B, and C, and worse for Dukes' D.
 Survival was worse in the presence of bowel perforation in Dukes' C and D stages.
 Within Dukes' D (incurable cases), survival was best in the absence of hepatic metastases, slightly worse when only hepatic metastases were present, and poorest in the presence of both hepatic and extrahepatic metastases.
 Statistical modeling of survival determinants other than staging indicated that cell differentiation had the largest effect (survival decreasing with poor cell differentiation), followed by site (survival worse for rectal cancer than colon cancer), then age (survival better for younger patients), while bowel perforation had the smallest effect on survival.

 A total of 157 consecutive patients were studied in an effort to examine prospectively the incidence of asymptomatic intraamniotic infection in the early phase of the second trimester.
 All patients were referred for amniotic fluid karyotyping.
 In addition, the amniotic fluids were examined for Gram stain and were directly cultured on blood agar and MacConkey agar as well as in thioglycollate broth.
 We found positive amniotic fluid cultures in eight cases (5.09%); however, results of Gram stain examinations were negative in all amniotic fluid samples.
 The data indicate that there is no correlation between white blood cells in the amniotic fluid and positive amniotic fluid culture results.
 Only one pregnancy with positive amniotic fluid culture resulted in a septic abortion.
 Therefore we can suggest that intraamniotic infection can exist early in pregnancy, even with intact membranes, and in most cases without any clinical symptoms.

"An effective and adaptable transvenous defibrillation system using the coronary sinus in humans.
 With use of a coronary sinus catheter electrode, a right ventricular catheter electrode and a chest wall patch electrode system, defibrillation threshold voltage, current and energy were measured with four distinct transvenous defibrillation techniques delivered in random sequence in each of 12 survivors of cardiac arrest immediately before implantation of a standard epicardial patch defibrillation system.
 The four transvenous defibrillation techniques were 1) single pathway monophasic pulsing, 2) single pathway biphasic pulsing, 3) dual pathway sequential pulsing, and 4) dual pathway simultaneous pulsing.
 A transvenous defibrillation method was considered to be potentially useful only if the defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 500 V (less than or equal to 15 J delivered energy).
 The 500 V value would allow a 2:1 defibrillation safety margin for a device with a maximal output of 30 J.
 No single transvenous pulsing technique was uniformly superior in efficacy.
 However, by choosing the best pulsing technique for each patient, it was possible to obtain an average defibrillation threshold of 410 +/- 135 V leading edge voltage, 7.2 +/- 2.5 A leading edge current and 11.3 +/- 7.4 J delivered energy for the group of 12 patients.
 With the ability to vary defibrillation technique, transvenous antiarrhythmic device implantation would have been possible in 10 (83%) of the 12 patients at or below a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point.
 In contrast, if only one transvenous defibrillation method had been used, as few as 5 and at most 8 of the 12 patients would have been candidates for a transvenous defibrillation system given a 15 J defibrillation threshold cutoff point for insertion.

 Twenty-five patients received ioxaglate (group 1) and 25 patients received iopamidol (group 2).
 All patients underwent 48 hours of continuous ECG recording beginning 24 hours before the cardiac catheterization.
 Left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, peak positive dp/dt, and dp/dt/P ratio were measured immediately before and after left ventriculography and 3 minutes later.
 Left ventricular systolic pressure did not change after injection of either contrast medium.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increased by 30% in group 1 (p less than 0.01) and by 22% in group 2 (p less than 0.01) immediately after left ventriculography.

 A prospective study of four cycles of etoposide with ifosfamide and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy was conducted in 42 germ cell tumor (GCT) patients who were refractory to cisplatin with etoposide/vinblastine-based therapy.
 Forty patients were evaluable for response.
 Ten patients (25%) had a complete response: seven to chemotherapy alone and an additional three patients after surgical resection of viable GCT.
 With a median follow-up of 15 months, four complete responders relapsed, and six patients (15%) remain in remission.
 Hematologic and nephrotoxicity were moderately severe.
 Durable complete responses with VIP as second salvage were achieved and suggests that ifosfamide adds efficacy to standard first-salvage therapy.
 The observed nephrotoxicity and myelotoxicity are considerations in the design of ifosfamide-cisplatin-based regimens.
 Hematopoietic growth factors may be useful in ameliorating myelotoxicity.
 The early use of ifosfamide-based chemotherapy may reduce the nephrotoxicity exacerbated by prior cisplatin.
 A trial of VIP as first salvage after a relapse from a complete response to platinum-based induction therapy is warranted.
 The modest proportion of patients who achieve a durable remission to VIP as second salvage emphasizes the need for more efficacious salvage therapy for patients who do not achieve a durable complete response.

"The role of aluminum in the functional iron deficiency of patients treated with erythropoietin: case report of clinical characteristics and response to treatment.
 The quantitative variation among patients in their response to erythropoietin can be explained, in part, by factors that can independently cause anemia in patients with end-stage renal disease.
 Aluminum can blunt the effect of erythropoietin, in part by interfering with iron bioavailability.
 This inhibitory effect cannot be completely overcome by aggressive ferrotherapy, but can be reversed with aluminum chelation therapy.
 A patient is described who developed hematological evidence of aluminum excess after being treated with erythropoietin.
 The biochemical evidence of functional iron deficiency and the response to aluminum chelation therapy support the hypothesis that the inhibitory effect of aluminum on erythropoiesis is mediated by the interference of aluminum with the bioavailability of iron.

 leprae-induced, DR3-restricted immunosuppression may at least partly explain the observed DR3-associated low T cell responsiveness in TT leprosy patients.

"Hypomutability in Fanconi anemia cells is associated with increased deletion frequency at the HPRT locus.
 Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited human disorder associated with a predisposition to cancer and characterized by anomalies in the processing of DNA cross-links and certain monoadducts.
 We reported previously that the frequency of psoralen-photoinduced mutations at the HPRT locus is lower in FA cells than in normal cells.
 This hypomutability is shown here to be associated with an increased frequency of deletions in the HPRT gene when either a mixture of cross-links and monoadducts or monoadducts alone are induced.
 Molecular analysis of mutants in the HPRT gene was carried out.
 In normal cells the majority of spontaneous and induced mutants are point mutations whereas in FA deletion mutations predominate.
 In that case a majority of mutants were found to lack individual exons or small clusters of exons whereas in normal cells large (complete or major gene loss) and small deletions are almost equally represented.
 Thus we propose that the FA defect lies in a mutagenic pathway that, in normal cells, involves bypassing lesions and subsequent gap filling by a recombinational process during replication.

"Endometriosis of the abdominal wall.
 Endometriosis of the abdominal wall typically occurs as a painful mass in a lower abdominal incision from previous cesarean section or hysterectomy.
 Most patients are young and in their active reproductive years.
 The histologic diagnosis requires a combination of either endometrial-like glands, endometrial stroma, or hemosiderin pigment.
 The diagnosis must be considered in any woman with an abdominal wall mass and a history of transabdominal gynecologic surgery.

"Segmented turboFLASH: method for breath-hold MR imaging of the liver with flexible contrast.
 A method called segmented turboFLASH imaging allows high-resolution, multisection, short-inversion-time (TI) inversion-recovery (STIR), T1- or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the liver to be completed within a breath-hold interval.
 The method was applied in a phantom and in 19 patients with hepatic lesions.
 Sequence comparisons were performed among segmented turboFLASH, single-shot turboFLASH, T1-weighted gradient-echo with ultrashort echo time, and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) techniques.
 Signal from fat and liver could be nulled with the segmented turboFLASH method, with TIs of 10 and 300 msec, respectively; signal from these tissues could not be eliminated with the single-shot approach.
 Signal-difference-to-noise ratios and contrast for the best segmented sequences were comparable with those of the best T2-weighted SE and T1-weighted gradient-echo techniques.
 It is concluded that it is feasible to obtain breath-hold images with arbitrary tissue contrast by means of segmented turboFLASH imaging.
 The method may prove helpful for the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions and will likely have applications to other anatomic regions such as the chest and pelvis.

"Changes in myocardial ischemic threshold during daily activities.
 This study assesses the variations in myocardial ischemic threshold (heart rate at the onset of ischemia) during daily activities in patients with ischemic episodes on Holter monitoring.
 Eighty patients with known coronary artery disease, positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes during a 24-hour period of Holter monitoring were studied.
 The lowest and the highest ischemic thresholds were determined for each patient.
 The mean lowest ischemic threshold was 85 beats/min, and the mean highest ischemic threshold was 109 beats/min.
 The highest ischemic threshold was identical to ischemic threshold values noted during exercise.
 Of the 895 ischemic episodes, 654 (74%) were preceded by a moderate (greater than 10%) increase in heart rate.
 The variability of ischemic threshold (difference in percentage between the highest and lowest ischemic thresholds) increased with the number of ischemic episodes (range 2 to 60%).
 However, in different patients with a similar number of ischemic episodes, different variability was observed.
 These differences in ischemic thresholds are probably indirect indicators of the vasomotor activity of the coronary arteries in different patients.

"Congenital myasthenia associated with facial malformations in Iraqi and Iranian Jews. A new genetic syndrome.
 Fourteen Jewish patients from 10 families of either Iraqi or Iranian origin with congenital myasthenia had associated facial malformations which included an elongated face, mandibular prognathism with class III malocclusion and a high-arched palate.
 Other common features were muscle weakness restricted predominantly to ptosis, weakness of facial and masticatory muscles, and fatigable speech; mild and nonprogressive course; response to cholinesterase inhibitors; absence of antibodies to acetylcholine receptor; decremental response on repetitive stimulation at 3 Hz but no repetitive compound muscle action potential in response to a single nerve stimulus.
 This newly recognized form of congenital myasthenia with distinctive ethnic clustering and associated facial malformations is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder.
 The facial abnormalities may be secondary to the neuromuscular defect or may be primary and unrelated.
 Further studies are needed to elucidate the defect in neuromuscular transmission responsible for the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

"Extravesical versus Leadbetter-Politano ureteroneocystostomy: a comparison of urological complications in 320 renal transplants.
 The urological complications of 320 consecutive renal transplants performed at our institution between October 17, 1985 and November 10, 1989 are reviewed.
 The Leadbetter-Politano technique of ureteroneocystostomy was used in the first 160 patients (group 1) and an anterior extravesical technique modified from the methods of Witzel, Sampson and Lich was performed in the second 160 patients (group 2).
 Urological complications occurred in 15 patients (9.4%) in group 1 and 6 (3.7%) in group 2 (p = 0.04).
 Ureterovesical junction obstruction occurred in 6 patients (3.7%) in group 1 and 1 (0.6%) in group 2 (p = 0.05).
 Complications of leakage, ureteral necrosis and ureteral stricture were comparable in the 2 groups.
 Therefore, we advocate the use of the anterior extravesical technique over Leadbetter-Politano ureteral reimplantation based on the lower incidence of urological complications and various technical advantages, including less operative time, avoidance of a separate cystotomy, less hematuria and ability to use short donor ureters.

"Update on the epidemiology of anorexia nervosa in a defined region of Switzerland.
 In this follow-up investigation, the authors studied all Swiss women in the canton of Zurich who developed anorexia nervosa between ages 12 and 25 years and who were hospitalized for the first time with this diagnosis between 1983 and 1985.
 Data were compared with those from an earlier study, which focused on the periods 1956-1958, 1963-1965, and 1973-1975.
 The incidence of anorexia nervosa did not increase significantly during 1983-1985 compared to 1973-1975, in contrast to the constant increase found between 1956 and 1975.
 However, the more frequent use of vomiting and abuse of laxatives in 1983-1985 may indicate an increase in cases with mixed features of anorexia nervosa and bulimia.

"Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy.
 Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No.
 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys.
 The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies.
 Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients.
 Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma.

"Feasibility and cost savings of outpatient electrophysiologic testing.
 The feasibility of outpatient electrophysiologic testing was examined by reviewing 100 consecutive outpatient tests performed in 95 patients.
 Seventy-one of the patients (75%) had no underlying heart disease.
 The electrophysiologic tests were performed to evaluate supraventricular tachycardias (n = 47), nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (n = 20), unexplained syncope (n = 21), palpitation (n = 9) or intermittent heart block (n = 2).
 A mean of 2.8 +/- 0.5 6F electrode catheters were inserted through a femoral vein.
 An electrode catheter was inserted into a subclavian or internal jugular vein in 28 tests and a 5F cannula was inserted into a femoral artery to monitor the blood pressure in 20 tests.
 The results of 61 tests (61%) were abnormal.
 Patients were monitored for a mean of 3.8 +/- 1.2 h after the procedure and then discharged.
 No complications occurred.
 For cost analysis a subgroup of 60 of these patients was matched for age, gender, heart disease and indication for electrophysiologic testing with a group of 60 patients who underwent electrophysiologic testing as inpatients.
 Physicians' fees for the two groups were similar; however, the mean hospital charge was $5,845 +/- 3,763 for the inpatient group compared with only $2,120 +/- 1,244 for the outpatient group (p less than 0.001).
 Thus, outpatient electrophysiologic testing is feasible and safe and results in substantial cost savings in patients without life-threatening arrhythmias.

"The long-term prognosis of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest but no inducible ventricular tachycardia.
 The long-term prognosis of patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest who do not have acute precipitating factors and in whom ventricular arrhythmias cannot be induced during baseline electrophysiologic testing is controversial.
 The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the long-term risk of recurrent sudden death and determine the clinical, angiographic, hemodynamic, and electrophysiologic predictors of recurrent cardiac arrest in such patients.
 Twenty-six (37%) of 71 consecutive patients with a single episode of aborted sudden death did not have inducible ventricular arrhythmias (less than 7 intraventricular responses) during baseline drug-free electrophysiologic study and they form the basis of this report.
 Their mean age was 54 +/- 13 (mean +/- SD) years and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 0.47 +/- 0.17.
 After a mean follow-up period of 16 months, 11 patients (42%) had a recurrent cardiac arrest (fatal in 10 patients).
 The actuarial incidence of recurrent cardiac arrest was 30 +/- 10% at 1 year and 55 +/- 13% at 3 years.
 Patients with LVEF less than or equal to 0.40 had a significantly higher occurrence of recurrent cardiac arrest than those with LVEF greater than 0.40 (p = 0.02; 1-year actuarial incidence of 57 +/- 17% versus 13 +/- 19%).
 Patients with recurrent sudden death had a significantly greater incidence of dilated cardiomyopathy (55% versus 7%; p = 0.02) and baseline frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs greater than 10/hr; 64% versus 17%, p = 0.036) or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (36% versus 0%; p = 0.37) than patients without these characteristics.

"Cardiovascular response of a continuous variable rate alfentanil infusion for abdominal aortic surgery.
 A prospective study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular response of a continuous alfentanil infusion during abdominal aortic surgery (AAS).
 Each subject (n = 20) received a beta-blocking drug preoperatively, and was premedicated with oral lorazepam.
 Anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 and thiopentone 3 mg.kg-1, and was maintained with a variable rate infusion of alfentanil and 66 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen.
 During the infusion, boluses of alfentanil, 7.5 micrograms.kg-1, were administered to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within 20 per cent of awake baseline values.
 Haemodynamic stability during surgery was achieved with infusion rates varying between 0.5 and 2.5 micrograms.kg-1, which resulted in mean alfentanil serum concentrations ranging from 186 +/- 53 to 315 +/- 98 ng.ml-1.
 The mean cumulative alfentanil dose was 15.4 +/- 6.2 mg.patient-1 for surgery which lasted an average of 141 +/- 41 min.
 Throughout surgery, no patient required inhalational anaesthetic agents or vasoactive drugs.
 Fifteen of the 20 patients had perioperative Holter monitoring.
 No myocardial ischaemia was detected during the intraoperative period.
 However, there was a 33 per cent incidence of myocardial ischaemia on the first postoperative day.
 There were no myocardial infarcts and no deaths.
 We conclude that in beta-blocked patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery, a variable rate alfentanil infusion administered with 66 per cent nitrous oxide provides anaesthesia characterized by good haemodynamic control without the need for supplemental agents or vasoactive drugs.

"The impact of an AIDS symposium on attitudes of providers of pediatric health care.
 Following reports of concern among health-care workers regarding the occupational risk of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a symposium was designed in 1987 to demonstrate to health-care providers at three hospitals in The Bronx, New York, the low risk of occupational HIV infection and techniques for avoiding infection.
 After the symposium, 103 of the health-care providers who had attended it completed a questionnaire assessing the impact of the symposium on their attitudes; the responses from 100 of these providers were used in this study.
 Twenty-nine of the responding providers reported that the symposium had increased their concerns regarding their risk of HIV infection; this group was composed of seven of the 15 medical students who responded, 12 of the 36 housestaff, seven of the 28 faculty, and three of the 21 other medical staff.
 The findings of the present study suggest that a symposium designed to decrease concerns of occupational HIV infection among health-care workers may have the opposite effect on some of those who attend it, especially medical students.
 Education alone may be inadequate to reassure some providers.
 The authors recommend small-group sessions addressing the emotional aspects of health-care providers' concerns.

 General quality of life has only recently been measured with an objective tool in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and there have been no reported attempts to document changes in patients' overall well-being over time, as patients deteriorate or respond to intervention.
 We applied the Quality of Well-Being scale (QWB) in 28 patients with CF before and after a two-week course of oral ciprofloxacin used to treat pulmonary exacerbations.
 There were significant correlations between changes in QWB and various pulmonary function test results; QWB vs FEV1: r = 0.4, p less than 0.03; QWB vs FVC: r = 0.5, p less than 0.01; and QWB vs SaO2: r = 0.4, p less than 0.05.

 Caliber-persistent artery of the stomach (also known as cirsoid aneurysm, Dieulafoy's lesion, and submucosal arterial malformation) is clinically manifested as recurrent, massive, often fatal hematemesis.
 The lesion often is not seen endoscopically.
 Left gastric angiography in one patient with hematemesis showed a convoluted and ectatic artery in the gastric fundus, which proved to be caliber-persistent artery of the stomach on pathological examination.
 The tortuosity of the abnormal vessel in this condition has been attributed to artefactual contraction of the stomach following excision and formalin fixation.
 This is the first reported case in which a pathologically proven lesion has been clearly visualized by angiography.
 This demonstrates that the submucosal vessel is truly and not artifactually sinuous.

"Airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.
 We examined whether patients with irritable bowel syndrome have increased airway responsiveness by measuring forced expiratory volumes in 1 second (FEV1) after inhalation of increasing concentrations of methacholine.
 Responses obtained in 11 IBS patients were compared with those obtained in 11 normal subjects and in 11 subjects with organic disease of the gut or its related organs.
 All subjects were selected so that other factors that might contribute to increased airway responsiveness were excluded.
 The methacholine concentration that caused a 20% fall in the FEV1 (PC20), as well as the reduction in FEV1 induced by each methacholine concentration, were used to assess airway responsiveness.
 The geometric mean PC20 was 197.6 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.15) for normal subjects, 83.9 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.51) for subjects with organic bowel disease (P = 0.012), and only 12.8 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.74) for IBS patients (P less than 0.0001).

 In contrast, the 15.7% +/- 2.0% decrease in FEV1 observed in patients with organic disease was not different from that seen in normal subjects (P = 0.189).
 We conclude that IBS is associated with increased airway responsiveness following challenge with methacholine.

"Epithelial abnormalities in intestine and kidney of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 A variety of perturbations of calcium metabolism are reported to occur in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) compared to its genetic control the Wistar-Kyoto rat (WKY), including significant dysfunction of calcium handling by the proximal renal tubule of the SHR, resulting in impaired active calcium transport in the gut and an apparent renal calcium leak.
 We explored the intestinal and renal epithelia of 12- to 14-week-old SHR and WKY using electron microscopy.
 Biochemical comparisons of these transport epithelia included measurements of three vitamin D dependent cellular proteins and one structural protein: alkaline phosphatase, intestinal CaBP9K, renal CaBP28K, and villin expression.
 Electron microscopy demonstrated a patchy loss in microvilli in the SHR, accounting for approximately 10 to 15% of the total microvillar surface.
 In the kidney, morphological abnormalities were observed only in the proximal renal tubule.
 Again, there was patchy loss of microvilli from the brush border membrane.
 In SHR duodenal alkaline phosphatase activity was significantly reduced compared to the WKY (0.145 +/- 0.002 v 0.186 +/- 0.002 integrated extinction/min/micron 3 X 10(3) brush border (P less than .001).
 Duodenal CaBP9K and renal CaBP28K were significantly reduced in SHR compared to WKY.
 There were no differences in villin expression.
 These data are consistent with the previously characterized disturbances of active calcium transport in the intestine and inappropriate renal calcium leak in the SHR.
 While a possible link between these disturbances and hypertension remains to be determined, this study provides supportive evidence for a primary disturbance in cell calcium handling and transporting epithelia in this form of genetic hypertension.

"Developmental expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 by human alveolar macrophages. Possible role in lung injury.
 Urokinase activity is regulated by the specific endogenous plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2).
 One of these inhibitors, PAI-1, has been directly implicated in connective tissue metabolism by virtue of its ability to bind extracellular matrix proteins.
 Because the normal lung is relatively rich in urokinase and abnormalities in urokinase activity have been associated with fibrotic lung diseases, we have explored the possibility of local production of PAI-1 and PAI-2 in human lung.
 Reverse transcription and subsequent amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of total lung RNA revealed PAI-1 mRNA in each of three normal samples and in two specimens from patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
 In situ hybridizations of lung biopsy specimens from a patient with ARDS with cRNA probes to PAI-1 and PAI-2 indicated that alveolar macrophages express PAI-1 mRNA during the acute injury phase.
 Subsequent reverse transcription and PCR amplification of normal human monocyte and alveolar macrophage mRNA revealed that neither cell type expressed mRNA for urokinase inhibitors.
 However, after 24 h stimulation with endotoxin in vitro, monocytes were strongly positive for PAI-2 but negative for PAI-1 mRNA whereas, under the same conditions, alveolar macrophages exhibited mRNA for both PAI-1 and PAI-2.
 Metabolic labeling of endotoxin-stimulated alveolar macrophages with 35S-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation with PAI-1 and PAI-2 antibodies revealed that macrophages synthesized both PAI-1 and PAI-2.
 As judged by immunoprecipitation and functional studies, PAI-2 was found to be the major intracellular PA inhibitor whereas PAI-1 was found to predominate outside the cell.
 Thus, mononuclear phagocytes exhibit a developmental potential for PAI-1 expression.
 The release of PAI-1 by stimulated macrophages, as observed in the setting of ARDS, may be one mechanism by which these cells promote connective tissue accumulation.

"Azathioprine in the treatment of children with inflammatory bowel disease.
 During a 6-year period, we treated 21 patients with azathioprine, 2 mg/kg/day, as an adjunct to their customary regimen.
 Nine patients had ulcerative colitis and 12 patients had Crohn disease; the patients' ages ranged from 3 to 17 years.
 The median duration of disease before the start of azathioprine therapy was 2 years, and median follow-up was 2 years.
 Sixteen patients seemed to respond to azathioprine therapy: six patients in each disease group had complete responses and four patients (one with ulcerative colitis and three with Crohn disease) had partial responses.
 Two patients with ulcerative colitis and three patients with Crohn disease did not respond.
 The median time until patients responded was less than 3 months for patients with ulcerative colitis and 4 months for those with Crohn disease.
 Reduction of corticosteroid dose was possible for all patients who responded to azathioprine therapy.
 Only minimal side effects were attributable to the drug.
 We conclude that azathioprine is an effective adjunctive agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in childhood, but because questions remain regarding its long-term safety, its use should be reserved for children with refractory disease or severe and unacceptable side effects of corticosteroids.

 Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children.
 Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape.
 Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae.

"Audiometric and subjective assessment of hearing handicap.
 This study compares self-perceived assessment of hearing handicap with audiometrically derived measures of hearing handicap in a sample of elderly persons.
 Subjects were evaluated by traditional audiometric tests, the Speech Perception in Noise test, and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly, a self-assessment questionnaire.
 Hearing handicap was also calculated by the audiometrically derived American Academy of Otolaryngology (1979) method.
 Our results are consistent with other studies that indicate a low correspondence between audiometric measures of hearing handicap and self-assessment of hearing handicap.
 Furthermore, if the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly is considered the true measure of hearing handicap, our data indicate that the American Academy of Otolaryngology method tends to overestimate handicap among persons with no self-perceived hearing handicap and underestimates handicap among persons with significant self-perceived hearing handicap.

"Screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic average-risk persons with negative fecal occult blood tests.
 Colonoscopy was performed on 210 asymptomatic average-risk persons, aged 50-75 years, who had negative fecal occult blood test results.
 Colonoscopy was complete to the cecum in 209 subjects.
 Fifty-three subjects (25%) had adenomas and two had cancer.
 All of the adenomas greater than or equal to 1 cm in size and both cancers occurred in subjects aged greater than or equal to 60 years.
 Fifty-one percent of subjects with adenomas and one with cancer had no neoplasms distal to the sigmoid-descending colon junction.
 One subject had a major postpolypectomy hemorrhage that stopped spontaneously.
 Screening colonoscopy, therefore, has a high yield for detection of neoplasms in asymptomatic average-risk persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years with negative fecal occult blood test results.
 The yield is low in persons aged 50-54 years and intermediate in persons aged 55-59 years.

"A controlled, double-blind study of the effect of quazolast on nasal challenge with ragweed antigen.
 Quazolast is a potent mediator release inhibitor as determined by in vitro and in vivo testing.
 A placebo-controlled, double-blind, two-way crossover study compared the safety and efficacy of Quazolast, 400 mg bid orally, with placebo in 23 subjects with ragweed (RW) allergy, out of season.
 Subjects were assigned to two 7-day treatments in a random sequence with an 8-day washout.
 Subjects were challenged on days 1 and 7 of each trial with serial dilutions (10, 100, 1000, 1350, and 2700 PNU/0.135 mL) of RW, using metered pump spray bottles, (two sprays delivered 0.135 mL), preceded by saline control.
 Efficacy evaluation consisted of nasal flow rates measured by rhinomanometry, sneeze counts, nasal itchiness scores, and weight of nasal secretions during challenges.
 During Quazolast treatment, subjects had significantly lower (P less than .05) mean percent decreases in nasal flow rate at 1350 and 2700 PNU.
 Nasal itchiness scores were significantly lower (P less than .05) during Quazolast treatment than at placebo at 1000, 1350, and 2700 PNU.
 Although sneeze counts were lower during treatment with Quazolast than with placebo, the results did not reach statistical significance.
 No significant improvement was seen in the weight of nasal secretions.
 Adverse experiences, clinical laboratory results, and physical examinations were unremarkable, posttreatment.
 Quazolast was superior to placebo in protecting against nasal congestion and nasal itchiness after ragweed nasal challenge.

"A phase I study of 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin. Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.
 A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors.
 Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction.
 A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable.
 Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2.
 The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia.
 Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22).
 Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis.
 Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction.
 Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours.
 The area under the curve was 537 +/- 149 ng/ml x hours, volume of distribution (Vd) 3504 +/- 644 l/m2, and total clearance (ClT) was 204 + 39.3 l/hour/m2.
 Adriamycinol, doxorubicin, adriamycinone, and tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol were the metabolites detected in plasma and the amount of doxorubicin was less than or equal to 10% of the total metabolites.
 Urinary excretion of Pirarubicin in the first 24 hours was less than or equal to 10%.
 Activity was noted in mesothelioma, leiomyosarcoma, and basal cell carcinoma.
 The recommended starting dose for Phase II trials is 60 mg/m2 IV bolus every 3 weeks.

"Squamous carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
 We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall.
 Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups.
 Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients).
 The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy.
 Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy.
 All required flap reconstruction.
 Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy.
 Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors.
 Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall.
 Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone.
 Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy.
 Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation.

"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy for necrotizing fasciitis reduces mortality and the need for debridements.
 Twenty-nine patients with necrotizing fasciitis were treated from 1980 to 1988.
 This study evaluates how the addition of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to surgical treatment has affected mortality and the number of debridements required to achieve wound control in these patients.
 Two groups of patients were viewed: group 1 (n = 12) received surgical debridement and antibiotics only; group 2 (n = 17) received HBO (90 minutes at 2.5 atm, average 7.4 treatments) in addition to surgery and antibiotics.
 Both groups were similar in age, race, sex, wound bacteriology, and antimicrobial therapy.
 Body surface area affected was similar, however, perineal involvement was more common in group 2 (53%) than in group 1 (12%).
 The admitting conditions of patients in group 1 (non-HBO) were diabetic, 33%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 50%; and shock, 8%.
 The admitting conditions of patients in group 2 (HBO) were diabetic, 47%; white blood cell count more than 12,000, 59%; and shock, 29%.
 Although group 2 patients receiving HBO were more seriously ill on admission, mortality was significantly lower (23%) compared to group 1 (66%) (p less than 0.02).
 In addition, only 1.2 debridements per group 2 patient were required to achieve wound control versus 3.3 debridements per group 1 patient (p less than 0.03).
 The addition of HBO therapy to the surgical and antimicrobial treatment of necrotizing fasciitis significantly reduced mortality and wound morbidity (number of debridements) in this study, especially among nonclostridial infections.
 We conclude that HBO should be used routinely in the treatment of necrotizing fasciitis.

"Upper gastrointestinal pathology in familial adenomatous polyposis: results from a prospective study of 102 patients.
 Multiple gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens from 102 asymptomatic patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, taken during a prospective endoscopic screening programme were examined.
 One hundred patients had microscopic gastroduodenal pathology, often in the absence of macroscopic lesions.
 Adenomas were found in 94 patients in the duodenum, in the second and third parts.
 Hyperplasia of villous and crypt epithelium was also seen, sometimes in the absence of adenomas: this may be a precursor of neoplastic change.
 In the stomach fundic gland polyps were the commonest abnormality, seen microscopically in 44 patients.
 Chronic antral gastritis was common in patients without fundic polyps.

"Is insulinlike growth factor I associated with diabetic retinopathy?
 Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) is the mediator of the growth-promoting effects of growth hormone and has been suspected of playing a role in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR).
 However, previous attempts to correlate IGF-I levels with PDR have yielded conflicting results.
 We determined IGF-I levels in a large population-based study of 682 early-onset (diagnosed before 30 yr of age) adult (greater than or equal to 18 yr old) insulin-taking diabetic subjects.
 PDR was found in 25% of the population.
 IGF-I levels were measured by radioimmunoassay.
 The mean serum level of IGF-I was 277 +/- 108 micrograms/L (mean +/- SD).
 Spearman rank correlations showed statistically significant negative correlations between IGF-I levels and age (r = -0.51, P less than 0.0001), duration of disease (r = -0.36, P less than 0.0001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (r = -0.09, P less than 0.05).
 There was a significant trend (P less than 0.001) toward decreasing risk of PDR with increasing IGF-I.
 However, after controlling for duration of diabetes, glycosylated hemoglobin, diastolic blood pressure, and the presence of proteinuria and/or creatinine greater than or equal to 265 microM in a multiple logistic regression model, IGF-I was not significantly associated with PDR.
 These data suggest that IGF-I may not be a risk factor for the development of PDR.

"Distortion product otoacoustic emissions in normal and impaired adult ears.
 Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOEs) were recorded in a group of normally hearing subjects (29 ears) and a group of subjects whose conditions were diagnosed as sensorineural hearing loss (23 ears) to study any correlation that might exist between DPOE characteristics and hearing impairment of different configurations.
 Three different DPOE paradigms have been used to investigate the influence of different test parameters on the DPOE data for normal and hearing-impaired ears.
 All normally hearing ears demonstrated detectable DPOEs, provided that the primary tone level was above a certain value.
 Hearing-impaired ears produced substantially reduced DPOEs compared with normally hearing subjects when the primary frequencies f1 and f2 corresponded to the region of hearing loss.
 Our data also suggested that, in general, more than one f2/f1 ratio is needed to examine any particular frequency region.
 The DPOEs provide frequency-specific information about cochlear function, which after further development, may form a basis for a noninvasive, objective method of evaluating cochlear function.

"Peak inspiratory pressure requirements in infants born weighing less than 750 g.
 The possibility that peak inspiratory pressure requirements or the arterial:alveolar oxygen ratio can predict the clinical outcome in infants weighing less than 750 g at birth was explored in a consecutive series.
 Nine of 10 infants (90%) with a peak inspiratory pressure requirement of more than 18 cm H2O at 48 hours or more than 16 cm H2O at 72 hours from age subsequently died later of respiratory causes (defined as death after 72 hours of pulmonary interstitial emphysema, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or cor pulmonale).
 Twenty of 21 remaining infants (95%) survived until discharge.
 Using these data a 95th centile for peak inspiratory pressure requirement during the first 72 hours of life was constructed.
 The potential value of this centile in predicting later death of respiratory causes was examined in a separate series.
 Twelve of 15 infants (80%) whose peak inspiratory pressure requirements remained below the 95th centile, or were not ventilated (n = 6), survived.
 In contrast, 11 of 12 (92%) infants whose requirements crossed the 95th centile died later of respiratory causes.
 The infants who died had more radiological changes and higher mean arterial carbon dioxide pressure than survivors suggesting that the severity of the initial lung disease rather than the way that ventilation was managed determined prognosis.
 Peak inspiratory pressure requirement was more useful than arterial:alveolar oxygen ratio in clearly distinguishing between survivors and infants who died later of respiratory causes.

"Motor unit discharge characteristics and short term synchrony in paraplegic humans.
 Frequency of firing and regularity of discharge of human motor units, and short term synchrony between pairs of motor units, have been assessed in extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in control subjects and in clinically complete paraplegic subjects.
 The discharge pattern of TA motor units in paraplegia ranged from extremely regular to very irregular for different motor units whereas in the control population, and in EDC of both groups, there was a narrow, but intermediate, range of regularity.
 There was little difference in the incidence and degree of short term synchrony (STS) in EDC between paraplegic and normal subjects.
 In contrast, virtually no STS of motor units was observed in the TA muscles of the paraplegic group whereas control subjects exhibited approximately the same amount of STS in their TA and EDC muscles.
 It is concluded that the extra burden placed on arm muscles in paraplegia does not change the amount of synchronisation between motor units.
 Furthermore, section of the spinal cord does not increase STS as predicted from lesions of the reticulospinal tract in cats.
 This may reflect the coincidental removal of supraspinal synchronising inputs of motoneurons or the reorganisation of synaptic inputs in chronic paraplegia.

"Immunohistochemical demonstration of the placental form of glutathione S-transferase, a detoxifying enzyme in human gliomas.
 Expression of the human placental form of glutathion S-transferase (GST-pi) in human gliomas was investigated by immunohistochemical methods, and the result was compared with that of normal human glial cells.
 The gliomas in this study were composed of five benign astrocytomas (Grade 2), ten anaplastic astrocytomas (Grade 3), and 16 glioblastomas (Grade 4).
 Normal human glial cells showed only a weak immunostaining response for GST-pi in the cytoplasm or some nuclear membranes.
 All of benign astrocytomas had diffusely weak GST-pi immunostaining, resembling that of normal glial cells.
 With increasing grade, gliomas showed a strongly positive reaction for GST-pi.
 The positive reactions were remarkable especially in the gemistocytes and giant cells in the high-grade gliomas.
 These results suggest that cells of gliomas have some detoxifying function and the expression of this detoxifying enzyme, GST-pi, is related to the degree of malignancy of the gliomas.

"Medical and dental students' attitudes about the AIDS epidemic.
 This study investigated changes, over a one-year period, in medical and dental students' attitudes toward various issues related to contact with AIDS patients.
 In 1988 and 1989, the authors surveyed second- and third-year medical and dental students at one medical school both before and after they completed a year of required clinical training.
 The dental students remained consistently more anxious and more restrictive in their attitudes toward treating patients with AIDS than did their medical student counterparts, and became more conservative (fearful) in their attitudes after working with AIDS patients, whereas the medical students became more liberal.
 Overall, both groups were more concerned about contracting AIDS in their professional lives than in their personal lives.
 Over one-third of the medical students and two-thirds of the dental students indicated that they did not wish to train in a specialty or hospital with a high percentage of AIDS patients, and a substantial minority of the students in both groups did not feel that they were responsible for treating all patients whom they were qualified to treat.
 These and related results suggest that AIDS-related anxiety may influence students' career choices and behaviors and the quality of care patients receive.
 Suggestions for educational strategies to address students' fears--both warranted and unwarranted--and the differences in attitudes between students of different health-care professions are discussed.

"Vicarious contrast material excretion in patients with acute unilateral ureteral obstruction.
 Radiographs of 45 patients with evidence of acute unilateral ureteral obstruction at intravenous urography, obtained at least 24 hours after injection of contrast material, were retrospectively studied.
 Vicarious contrast material excretion (VCME) as evidence by gallbladder opacification on delayed radiographs was seen in 19 patients (42%), 10 of whom also showed extravasation of contrast material.
 A total of 15 of the 45 patients developed spontaneous extravasation; 10 (67%) showed VCME, while only nine of the 30 patients (30%) who did not have spontaneous extravasation of contrast material showed VCME.
 The creatinine level was elevated (greater than 1.5 mg/dL [133 mumol/L]) in four patients with VCME and in six patients without.
 This series indicates that VCME is more common than previously appreciated in patients with acute unilateral ureteral obstruction and occurs with greater frequency when obstruction is associated with contrast material extravasation.

"The effects of cyproheptadine on locomotion and on spasticity in patients with spinal cord injuries.
 The effects of cyproheptadine, a serotonergic antagonist, were studied in seven patients with spastic paresis of spinal origin.
 Six patients were included in a double blind crossover trial (maximal dose 24 mg/day).
 The patients were evaluated on both their spasticity and locomotor function.
 Four of the patients also participated in an open trial in which cyproheptadine was administered for a minimum of six months at optimal dose.
 Patients walked on a treadmill at full weight bearing when possible, or with 40% of their body weight externally supported, as required, by an overhead harness system.
 Cyproheptadine considerably decreased the sustained ankle clonus and episodes of spontaneous spasms observed in all the patients who previously presented these manifestations of spasticity.
 Two patients who required body weight support (BWS) during locomotion could walk at full weight bearing during cyproheptadine therapy.
 A more normal timing of EMG patterns in these patients during cyproheptadine therapy was associated with temporal distance changes and marked improvement of joint angular displacement.
 In contrast, the other patients showed marginal changes in the EMG and the kinematic pattern but eventually managed to walk at a higher speed.
 These preliminary results suggest that cyproheptadine can reduce spasticity and enhance locomotor function in spinal cord injured patients.

 Keratoacanthomas infrequently are treated by radiotherapy.
 However, keratoacanthomas that are recurrent after surgical excision or whose resection would result in cosmetic deformity may benefit from radiotherapy.

 Measured end points of therapy were (1) initial response, (2) freedom from recurrence, and (3) quality of the subsequent cosmetic appearance (scored as good, fair, or poor).
 No lesion progressed and all eventually regressed completely.
 Cosmetic results generally were considered good by both the patient and the referring dermatologist; none of the results was considered poor.

 Two had to be implanted with a total artificial heart (TAH) and one with a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for recurrent fibrillation despite hemodynamic improvement, within 8 hr.
 Two have received transplants and are living well after 20 months.
 Seven who initially improved markedly have been listed as urgent transplant candidates: two of these have been successfully transplanted, and three died suddenly after 6, 25, and 45 days, respectively.
 One has undergone successful coronary surgery.
 One patient (age 62, diabetic) was secondarily rejected for a transplant and died.
 This experience clearly shows that despite initial spectacular hemodynamic improvement, which was due to optimized medical management, death rate before transplant because of sudden ventricular fibrillation remains unacceptably high.
 This should prompt early mechanical support, with less invasive systems, in patients with AMI.

"Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A report of four cases.
 Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in four Hong Kong Chinese patients treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
 These cases represent four of 42 (9%) cases of osteosarcoma at all sites in this institution during the period 1979 to 1989, when more than 1000 patients were treated with radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
 The latent periods varied from 8 to 11 years from completion of radiotherapy treatment to development of osteosarcoma.
 The radiation dosage varied from 6000 to 6280 cGy in three of the patients.
 These cases fit the criteria for diagnosis of postirradiation sarcomas.
 Maxillary osteosarcomas after irradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma do not appear to have been described.
 The very high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (for which radiotherapy is the treatment of choice) in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors more likely in Hong Kong, although the small risk does not contraindicate the use of radiation in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in view of its well-documented efficacy.

"Percutaneous biliary drainage for high obstruction.
 PBD is the preferred route of palliative drainage for patients with high biliary obstruction.
 The frequency of bifurcational obstruction in this setting requires familiarity with drainages from both the right and the left transhepatic approach.
 The preferred right transhepatic approach is fluoroscopically guided; on the left, ultrasonography is the guidance of choice.
 Large caliber drainage catheters are required, and dilatation of the necessary transhepatic tracts is extremely painful unless adequate inhalation anesthesia or, preferably, epidural anesthesia, is provided.
 Long-term biliary drainage requires a choice between internal-external external drainage catheters and endoprostheses that is made by considering the patient's life expectancy and his or her adjustment to a stent extending to the outside.
 The feasibility of corrective procedures if an internal-external drainage catheter or an endoprosthesis becomes blocked needs to be considered before definitive placement.
 The interventional radiologist becomes intimately involved in the follow-up care of patients and frequently has to direct appropriate patient evaluation.
 Familiarity with antibiotic regimens is important.

"Lipiodol computerized tomography: how sensitive and specific is the technique in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma?
 Computerized tomography (CT) following the intra-arterial injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT) was performed on 60 patients suspected of having a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 Four main patterns of uptake of the Lipiodol within the liver were seen on CT.
 Of the 14 well circumscribed lesions with dense homogeneous uptake of Lipiodol, 13 were confirmed to be HCCs.
 Of the 25 lesions with dense patchy uptake of Lipiodol at the periphery and/or in the centre, 19 were confirmed to be HCCs.
 In 18 patients, in whom only ill defined faint patchy uptake of Lipiodol was present in the liver, or in whom no hepatic uptake was present at all, only one patient was found later to have an HCC.
 Of the three hypodense lesions in the liver with no Lipiodol uptake, one was found to be necrotic HCC, one a cholangiocarcinoma and one a regenerative nodule.
 In the diagnosis of HCC, Lipiodol-CT had an overall sensitivity of 97.1%, an accuracy of 88.3% and a specificity of 76.9%.
 Of the 34 patients with HCC, only 23 were solitary at diagnosis.
 The size of the HCCs ranged from 0.8 cm to 11 cm in diameter with the median size at 2.2 cm.
 Eleven of 34 HCCs (32.3%) were resectable.
 We conclude that, as part of a screening programme for high risk patients.
 Lipiodol-CT is useful in the early detection of HCCs.
 The technique also plays an important role in determining whether the tumour should be resected or managed with chemotherapy.
 By detecting HCCs while still small, the resectability rate can also be improved.

"Bronchoconstriction induced by spirometric maneuvers in patients with bronchial asthma.
 We analyzed forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in 14 asthmatic patients and in seven normal subjects by breaking down the forced expiration maneuver of spirometry (the FVC maneuver) into two phases: a slow, deep inspiration to the total lung capacity (TLC) (the DI maneuver) and a forced expiration to the residual volume (RV) (the PFV maneuver).
 Specific airway conductance (sGaw) was measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) after each of the three maneuvers.
 All of the maneuvers caused the greatest bronchoconstriction immediately after completion of the maneuver.
 The mean decreases in the sGaw immediately after the FVC, DI, and PFV maneuvers were 45.0 +/- 6.6 (SD)% (P less than .001), 29.6 +/- 5.3% (P less than .001), and 16.7 +/- 5.3% (P less than .03), respectively.
 The decrease in sGaw by the FVC maneuver was very close to the combined algebraic sum of the DI maneuver and the PFV maneuver.
 The normal subjects did not show any changes in the sGaw by any of the maneuvers.
 The inhalation of albuterol almost abolished the response of bronchoconstriction to any of the three maneuvers, but inhalation of an anticholinergic agent, ipratropium bromide, did blunt the response.
 This study suggests that forced expiration maneuver-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics can be caused not only by deep inspiration to the TLC but also by forced expiration to the RV, and that the bronchoconstriction may be brought about mainly by an increase in parasympathetic activity.

"A comparison of rapid enzyme immunoassay tests for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis cervical infections.
 Two rapid enzyme immunoassay test kits were compared with culture for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis endocervical infections.
 Endocervical samples for C trachomatis culture and the two enzyme immunoassay tests were evaluated from 502 county health department and Planned Parenthood patients.
 The prevalence of infection in this population was 12%.
 Sensitivity and specificity of the Abbott TestPack Chlamydia were 51.7% and 99.5%, respectively, and of the Kodak Surecell Chlamydia were 76.7% and 98.6%, respectively.
 The positive and negative predictive values for TestPack were 93.9% and 93.8%, and for Surecell were 88.5% and 96.9%, respectively.
 Additionally, an in vitro investigation was used to evaluate whether typical office staff (physicians, nurses, medical technicians, receptionists, and radiology technicians) were able to perform competently the tests in each kit.
 Office personnel tested 12 dilutions of a C trachomatis stock sample or negative control sample as unknowns for each kit in the in vitro investigation.
 There were no differences among office staff in performance when compared for each test kit.
 Selective use of these enzyme immunoassay tests for high-risk patients in a family practice population that has a high prevalence of patients with C trachomatis infection may be helpful when rapid test results are required and cultures are not feasible.
 After appropriate training, most physician office personnel were equally able to perform the enzyme immunoassay tests evaluated.

"MY7 monoclonal antibody for diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 Infiltrate in cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs) is composed mainly of CD4 helper cells with a phenotype very similar to that of benign cutaneous lymphoid infiltrate.
 MY7 (CD13) is a monoclonal antibody that is normally expressed on peripheral granulocytes and monocytes but also cross-reacts with an antigen expressed on epidermal basal cells.
 We studied MY7 expression on basal cells of the epidermis and CD4 cell infiltrate in 34 CTCLs, 11 pseudolymphomas, and 29 other benign cutaneous lesions.
 An indirect immunofluorescence technique with double labeling and an immunoperoxidase technique were used.
 We found that in benign inflammatory infiltrate, less than 10% of CD4 cells expressed MY7 antigen associated with normal MY7 monoclonal antibody labeling of basal cells, whereas in CTCLs more than 50% of CD4 tumoral cells in dermis expressed MY7 antigens; however, basal cells were MY7 negative.
 Thus, it is demonstrated that MY7 monoclonal antibody with its double modulation on epidermis (basal cells) and dermis (CD4 cells) has diagnostic value for differentiating CTCLs with CD4+ MY7+ tumor cells in dermis and MY7-negative basal cells from benign inflammatory lesions with CD4+ MY7- cells in dermis and MY7-positive basal cells.
 This modulation of MY7 labeling could be related to the secretion of epidermal cytokines.

"Hilar malignancy: treatment with an expandable metallic transhepatic biliary stent.
 An expandable metallic transhepatic biliary endoprosthesis was used to treat 20 patients with hilar malignancy and isolated right and left intrahepatic ducts.
 In 12 patients, only one intrahepatic ductal system was drained; in eight patients, both systems were drained.
 In five patients, both systems were drained through a single transhepatic track by arrangement of two stents in a T configuration.
 The initial technical success rate in placing the stents and achieving internal drainage was 100%.
 Complications necessitating further intervention occurred in two of the 20 patients.
 Short-term clinical follow-up was available for 19 of the 20 patients.
 Two months after stent insertion, two patients complained of persistent jaundice, two patients died without jaundice, and 15 patients were free of symptoms of biliary obstruction.
 A variety of geometric configurations are possible with this endoprosthesis.
 The relative merits of these stent arrangements are discussed, and a new technique for placing the stents in a T configuration is described.

"Predicting treatment outcome in nocturnal enuresis.
 A presenting sample of 127 consecutive referrals to a community based enuresis clinic were evaluated after treatment with baseline behavioural recording and the enuresis alarm.
 Almost one in five became dry after baseline recording only while 81 of 96 (84%) enuretics who used the alarm achieved the initial dryness criterion.
 Successful outcome was associated with the absence of adverse environmental factors and psychiatric disorders in the child.
 A logistic regression procedure enabled a risk score to be created so that successful outcome could be predicted.
 Psychiatric disorder in the child, family stress, and the degree of concern shown by the child emerged as the most important prognostic factors in the treatment of enuresis.
 The favourable success rates with baseline recording and the enuresis alarm confirm the role of conditioning treatment at the forefront of management of enuresis and the risk score allows outcome to be predicted for the first time.

"Plasma vasoactive intestinal polypeptide concentration determination in patients with diarrhea.
 Determination of plasma levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) has been used for screening patients with chronic diarrhea to identify potential neuroendocrine tumors.
 This 6-year blinded study from 1981 to 1986 examines the causes of elevated VIP levels in patients.
 In healthy volunteers ( n = 144), VIP concentrations ranged from 14 to 76 pg/mL (mean +/- SE, 28 +/- 12), whereas in chronic renal failure, 4 of 34 patients or 12% [serum creatinine 4.5 - 9.0 mg/dL (397-795 mumols/L)] had an elevation to greater than 100 pg/mL.
 No patient with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis (n = 12) had elevation of serum concentration of this peptide.
 Among 588 consecutive unselected patients undergoing evaluation for chronic diarrhea (n = 362; 62%) or possible neuroendocrine tumor (n = 214; 36%), 23 patients (3.9%) had concentrations greater than 76 pg/mL.
 In this group, 5 patients had functioning (VIP, 160-5975 pg/mL) and 5 had nonfunctioning (VIP, 80-120 pg/mL) pancreatic islet cell carcinomas: all 10 patients had hepatic metastases.
 Other known cases of elevated levels of VIP, ranging from 80 to 340 pg/mL, included other neurogenic tumors (n = 3), small- bowel resection (n = 2), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 2), chronic renal failure (n = 1), and prolonged fasting (n = 1).
 Patients with diarrhea in which VIP-secreting tumors were identified had plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide concentrations greater than 140 pg/mL.
 In patients with chronic diarrhea, determination of plasma vasoactive intestinal peptide levels did identify tumors secreting this peptide, but the results from this referral institution did not show identification of these tumors early in their clinical course.

"Use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with mild asthma.
 A double blind, parallel group study was carried out to investigate the effect of inhaled budesonide in a moderate (200 micrograms) and a low (100 micrograms) twice daily dosage compared with the effect of placebo in 103 adults with mild symptomatic asthma.
 Subjects recorded peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma symptoms, and beta 2 agonist consumption at home for a period of seven weeks (a one week run in and six weeks' treatment).
 Morning baseline PEF (around 80% of predicted normal) increased non-significantly to 88% with 200 micrograms budesonide daily and to 90% (p less than 0.05) with 400 micrograms, compared with 81% with placebo.
 Evening PEF (around 94% of predicted normal) did not change significantly with active or placebo treatment.
 By comparison with placebo, there was a significant decrease in nocturnal asthma symptoms and beta 2 agonist consumption.
 The changes during the day were less pronounced and significant only for 400 micrograms budesonide daily.
 No significant differences between the two active treatments were detected.
 It is concluded that low doses of inhaled budesonide are effective in patients with mild symptomatic asthma, particularly for night time symptoms and early morning lung function.
 The early introduction of inhaled corticosteroids for patients with mild asthma and night time symptoms may improve their quality of life during the night and early morning.

"The scapegoat effect on food aversions after chemotherapy.
 The effects of consuming a novel food (halva) versus a familiar food (cookies) before gastrointestinal (GI) toxic chemotherapy on patients' preference for familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy treatment were compared.
 The development of aversions to the novel and familiar foods was also assessed.
 Patients with a history of posttreatment nausea consumed either a novel or a familiar food before chemotherapy and were asked to keep a food record through the next breakfast and to rate their preference for these foods.
 Patients who consumed halva before treatment were significantly more likely to increase their ratings for foods consumed after chemotherapy than patients who consumed familiar cookies.
 Aversions to the novel food were significantly more frequent than aversions to the familiar food.
 These findings provide evidence that a novel but not a familiar food consumed before chemotherapy can act as a scapegoat to prevent items in the regular diet consumed after chemotherapy from decreasing in preference.
 Providing patients with a novel food before chemotherapy is a useful clinical intervention to reduce the likelihood of forming aversions to familiar foods consumed after chemotherapy.

"Addition of clonidine enhances postoperative analgesia from epidural morphine: a double-blind study.
 This study was undertaken to evaluate the analgesic effect of the combination of epidural morphine and clonidine versus epidural morphine alone in patients with postoperative pain.
 A randomized double-blind design was used, and 91 patients scheduled for post-operative pain relief by epidural morphine were studied.
 Patients received either a continuous epidural infusion of morphine and clonidine (group 1; n = 45) or morphine alone (group 2; n = 46) over the 72 h after major abdominal surgery.
 In the first 24 h, the dose of morphine was 6 mg per 24 h; during the second 24 h, it was decreased to 4 mg per 24 h; and in the final 24 h, it was decreased to 2 mg per 24 h in both groups.
 Group 1 patients received clonidine (450 micrograms) during each 24-h period.
 Additional epidural bolus injections of 2 mg morphine and intravenous meperidine were given on demand.
 The pain score, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and relative forced vital capacity were measured at fixed times during the first 72 h after operation.
 Total consumption of analgesics and side effects were recorded.
 Although the total consumption of analgesics was significantly higher in group 2 (P less than 0.05), pain scores were lower in group 1 than group 2 during the entire observation period (P less than 0.05).
 Epidural clonidine produced a significant decrease (P less than 0.05) in heart rate and blood pressure, whereas the respiratory rate was not affected.
 Due to the better pain relief in group 1, the forced vital capacity was increased (P less than 0.05).

"Comparison of two ascitic fluid culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
 The conventional method of ascitic fluid culture detects bacteria in only 50% of cirrhotic patients with neutrocytic ascites and suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP).
 We have prospectively compared two ascites culture methods in cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: 1) conventional (on chocolate agar, blood agar, Mac Conkay agar, and thioglycolate broth), and 2) modified [inoculation of 10 ml of ascites in a tryptic soy broth (TSB) blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside].
 In a 21-month period, 70 episodes of SBP were diagnosed according to our criteria in 60 cirrhotic patients.
 Both culture methods were performed simultaneously.
 The conventional grew bacteria in 40 episodes (57%), whereas the modified grew bacteria in 54 episodes (77%), a significantly higher sensitivity (p = 0.0001).
 In 16 cases (23%), ascitic culture was negative by both methods.
 The mortality rate was higher among patients with culture-positive SBP than those with culture-negative SBP (46% vs 37%), but did not reach statistical significance.
 We conclude that ascitic fluid inoculated into a TSB blood culture bottle at the patient's bedside should be used routinely for ascites culture in cirrhotic patients.

 The ability of the Ohmeda 3700, Nellcor N200, Datex Satlite Plus and Simed S100 pulse oximeters to detect induced hypoxaemia in the presence of motion artefact was assessed, under conditions of controlled vibration using an industrial vibration facility.
 Vibration at 4 Hz and 8 Hz induced increases in detection time for hypoxaemia and spurious decreases in the displayed SaO2 in some of the oximeters tested.
 Finger-dependent differences in oximeter performance and pulse rate registration were noted especially in those oximeters without ECG linkage (Ohmeda 3700 and Simed S100).
 Subsequently, eight different pulse oximeter finger probes were assessed for those characteristics that may predispose to motion artefact.
 There were marked differences in the mass of the probes, the forces exerted on the test finger and in the force required to displace the probes from the subject's finger.
 Differences in both the microprocessor programmes and the physical characteristics of the finger probes may explain the observed differences in function.

"Manual translaryngeal jet ventilation and the risk of aspiration in a canine model.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: Manual translaryngeal jet ventilation (TLJV) is a safe and effective method of maintaining normal ventilation in apneic subjects.
 Little data exist on the amount of airway protection afforded with this technique of airway management.
 We sought to evaluate the risk of aspiration during manual TLJV.
 SETTING: Data were collected in a laboratory animal model.
 DESIGN: A prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial was performed.
 PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen adult apneic mongrel dogs were enrolled.
 INTERVENTIONS: Intratracheal Gastrograffin was instilled and radiographic changes assessed during ventilation using a 0 to 3 scale (none to severe).
 Thirty-six trials were performed, with equal numbers at both 30 degrees and 45 degrees head elevation.
 The three groups studied were animals without airway protection (control), animals with a cuffed endotracheal tube (tube), and animals with a percutaneous TLJV cannula and a 50-psi oxygen source ventilated at a rate of 20 breaths per minute (jet).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Significantly less radiographic evidence of aspiration was noted in the jet and tube groups at 30 degrees and 45 degrees compared with control animals (P = .002 each).
 At 45 degrees head elevation a trend toward increased aspiration scores in the jet group compared with the tube group (P = .065) was observed.
 CONCLUSION: In our model, manual TLJV at 20 breaths per minute and an I:E ratio of 1:2 provided protection from aspiration comparable to that observed with a cuffed endotracheal tube at 30 degrees head elevation.
 At 45 degrees elevation, this protection was diminished.

 All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living.
 The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance.
 Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups.

"Diagnosis of tracheal injury in mechanically ventilated premature infants by flexible bronchoscopy. A pilot study.
 Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) is uniquely suited for the study of large airway lesions in the ventilated premature infant.
 However, no standardized clinical scoring system of distal tracheal injury exists and the adverse consequences of FB in ventilated premature infants are not well described.
 Using a prototype Olympus fiberoptic ultrathin bronchoscope with a directable tip and an outer diameter of 2.2 mm, we serially scored distal tracheal injury in conventionally ventilated premature infants on the basis of mucosal and obstructive changes observed at bronchoscopy.
 In addition, we prospectively evaluated the incidence of adverse cardiovascular and pulmonary effects during, immediately after, and within 1 h of FB.
 We performed 21 FBs in eight conventionally ventilated premature infants with birth weight of 1,239 +/- 438 g and gestational age of 30 +/- 3 weeks.
 The carina and mainstem bronchi were easily visualized in all infants using the prototype bronchoscope.
 During the first several days of life, moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury occurred frequently, while moderate-to-severe obstructive injury occurred infrequently.
 Distal mucosal injury appeared to improve during the fourth week of life.
 Mild distal obstructive injury began to appear during the second week of life.
 Adverse consequences of FB observed in our patient population included transient hypoxemia and bradycardia during FB, changes in systolic blood pressure immediately and within 1 h after FB, and emesis immediately after FB.
 Serious adverse cardiovascular or pulmonary effects were not observed.
 We conclude that FB can be performed safely with appropriate monitoring and is a useful tool in the clinical assessment and serial evaluation of distal tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants.
 We speculate that moderate-to-severe distal tracheal mucosal injury may be associated with the development of later obstructive injury.
 On the basis of this preliminary study, further prospective investigations of tracheal injury in ventilated premature infants appear to be warranted.

"Right ventricular growth after transventricular pulmonary valvotomy and central aortopulmonary shunt for pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum.
 We performed transventricular pulmonary valvotomy as initial surgery in 22 consecutive patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who had a patent infundibulum.
 Nineteen patients also had placement of a central aortopulmonary shunt.
 All patients survived surgery, and 16 patients have had preoperative and later postoperative catheterizations.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the response of the right ventricle to transventricular pulmonary valvotomy with regard to relief of right ventricular hypertension and growth of the entire right ventricle, including tricuspid valve, right ventricular volume, and right ventricular outflow tract.
 Right ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 111.3 +/- 31.7 mm Hg before initial surgery to 65.6 +/- 26.2 mm Hg.
 Right ventricular end-diastolic volume increased from 59.1 +/- 39.3% of predicted normal before initial surgery to 114.6 +/- 63.2% at late follow-up catheterization.
 Tricuspid valve anulus circumference also increased in size from 73.2 +/- 21.3% of predicted normal before initial surgery to 90.4 +/- 22.8% at late follow-up catheterization.
 Only one patient (6%) required a transanular right ventricular outflow tract patch at the time of biventricular repair.
 Twenty of 22 patients (91%) either have had or are awaiting biventricular repair.
 We conclude that transventricular pulmonary valvotomy and central aortopulmonary shunt can be performed safely in newborn infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who have a patent infundibulum.
 Effective valvotomy relieves right ventricular hypertension, allows for excellent right ventricular and tricuspid valve growth, and optimizes potential for biventricular repair.

"Bioenergetic recovery processes of injured myocardium.
 We employed cervically transplanted nonworking myocardium to simulate the condition of a heart supported by a ventricular assist device, and to investigate the bioenergetic recovery processes of injured myocardium with 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques.
 A heterotopic graft was placed in the cervical portion of a recipient rat.
 One week later, a control 31P NMR spectrum was obtained from the graft.
 On the same day, the aorta of the graft was clamped for 30 minutes at room temperature.
 After this procedure, 31P NMR measurements of the graft were performed for 1 week.
 The phosphocreatine (PCr)/Inorganic phosphate (Pi) ratio, and beta-phosphate from adenosine triphosphate (beta-ATP)/Pi ratio on the first and second day after injury were significantly lower than control (p less than 0.05).
 However, these ratios recovered to a significant extent on the third and fourth day.
 These results suggest that 3 or 4 days are required for bioenergetic recovery of reversibly injured myocardium, even under nonworking conditions.

"Elevated serum interleukin-6 associated with a failure in B cell differentiation in common variable immunodeficiency.
 Interleukin-6 (IL-6/B cell stimulatory factor 2) has been found to drive activated human B-lymphocytes through the final stages of differentiation to become immunoglobulin-producing cells.
 Most patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) have B-lymphocytes that fail to differentiate into high-rate immunoglobulin-secreting cells in vivo and in vitro.
 In view of (1) the known effects of IL-6 to promote B-lymphocyte terminal differentiation and (2) the defect in differentiation in B-lymphocytes of patients with CVI, we believed that it was important to analyze the role of this cytokine in patients with CVI.
 Using an IL-6-dependent murine hybridoma cell line in a bioassay, serum IL-6 levels were determined in 17 patients with CVI and in eight normal control subjects.
 Thirteen of the 17 patients with CVI exhibited serum IL-6 levels that were twofold to 18-fold higher than the range (mean, +2 SD) of normal control subjects.
 Spontaneous IL-6 production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with CVI was significantly higher than that from normal control subjects, whereas lipopolysaccharide maximally stimulated IL-6 production by PBMCs of patients with CVI or PBMCs of normal control subjects was equivalent.
 A substance inhibitory of IL-6 bioactivity was found in equivalent amounts in sera of both patients and normal control subjects.
 Sera from patients with CVI with high IL-6 bioactivity were found to have saturated this IL-6 inhibitory substance, thus resulting in large amounts of free IL-6 in the sera.
 These studies suggest that the failure of B cells from patients with CVI to terminally differentiate into high-rate immunoglobulin-secreting cells cannot be attributed to a decrease in the serum levels of IL-6 and that the increased circulating IL-6 levels in patients with CVI result from hyperproduction rather than decreased use of IL-6.
 The persistently elevated levels of IL-6 observed in some patients with CVI may secondarily result in the induction of the neoplastic and autoimmune phenomena associated with this disease.

"Magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of vena caval tumor thrombi: a comparative study with venacavography and computerized tomography scanning.
 We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in demonstrating the presence and extent of vena caval tumor thrombi.
 The study group included 20 patients with vena caval thrombi from renal cell carcinoma (18), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (1) and adrenal pheochromocytoma (1).
 Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15.
 All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed.
 Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%).
 Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study.
 Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%).
 In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study.

"Persistent hepatitis B virus following interferon alfa therapy and liver transplantation.
 A 44-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection and cirrhosis was treated with recombinant human interferon alfa for 67 days immediately before orthotopic liver transplantation and immunoprophylaxis with hyperimmune globulin to hepatitis B virus in the peritransplant period.
 Dot blots for hepatitis B virus DNA demonstrated marked reduction in viremia after 41 days of interferon alfa treatment.
 Southern analysis for hepatitis B virus in liver showed a pronounced decrement in actively replicating forms in the explant, although hepatic infection was still detectable.
 After liver transplantation, tests for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen remained negative.
 The patient died 32 days after transplantation of causes unrelated to hepatitis B virus.
 DNA isolated from liver and other visceral organs at autopsy showed infection of the engrafted liver and the persistence of monomeric relaxed circular forms of hepatitis B virus DNA in pancreas, kidney, and spleen.
 Thus, graft reinfection occurred despite aggressive antiviral therapy and immunoprophylaxis combined with liver transplantation.
 Existing viral serological markers appear insufficiently sensitive to assess residual infectivity.

"The effect of improved cementing techniques on component loosening in total hip replacement. An 11-year radiographic review.
 Improved cementing techniques have been shown to decrease the rate of aseptic loosening of femoral components of cemented total hip replacements at five to seven years.
 We now report our results in 105 hips in 93 patients at 10 to 12.7 years (mean 11.2).
 The improved techniques included use of a medullary plug, a cement gun, a doughy mix of Simplex P and a collared stem of chrome cobalt.
 Only three femoral components had definitely loosened, none were probably loose and 24 were graded as possibly loose.
 In contrast, the incidence of radiographic loosening on the acetabular side was 42%.
 Improved cementing techniques have produced a marked reduction in the rate of aseptic loosening of the femoral component, but the incidence of acetabular loosening is unchanged.

"Single lung transplantation for primary pulmonary hypertension.
 Single lung transplantation has become a therapeutic option for end-stage interstitial lung disease and obstructive lung disease.
 Our group recently extended this treatment to three patients with primary pulmonary hypertension.
 All patients had marked decreases in pulmonary artery pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance and increases in cardiac output following single lung transplantation.
 Spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity were not different in comparison to preoperative studies.
 Quantitative ventilation-perfusion scans revealed the majority of perfusion distributed to the transplanted lung, with ventilation approximately equally divided between the native and the transplanted lung.
 Despite ventilation-perfusion imbalance, there was no resting hypoxemia and there was no arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise.
 One patient expired on the 30th postoperative day due to cytomegalovirus infection of the lungs.
 In the remaining two patients, maximum exercise capacity following transplantation was near normal in one recipient and reduced in the second recipient.
 Of note, there was no evidence of ventilatory limitation or impaired oxygenation during exercise in these two recipients.
 Although an exaggerated exercise ventilatory response was present, this did not limit exercise performance.
 This report supports the use of single lung transplantation for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension.

"Identification of patients at greatest risk for developing major complications at cardiac surgery [published erratum appears in Circulation 1991 Jul;84(1):446]
 As part of a prospective program to use risk-adjusted outcome (operative mortality and morbidity) as a measure of quality of care, we have analyzed perioperative complication data in 10,634 patients representing 73% of all patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass at Veterans Administration medical centers between April 1, 1987, and March 31, 1989.
 One or more complications occurred in 15% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting, and in 24% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery.
 Patients experiencing one or more complications had an eightfold to 10-fold increase in operative mortality compared with patients with no perioperative complications.
 The most frequent complication was requirement for mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours occurring in 8% of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass and in 15% of patients undergoing valve and other cardiac surgery; 24-25% of these patients died within 30 days of surgery or as a direct result of a surgical complication.
 Previous heart surgery was a strong predictor of development of one or more complications in both groups of patients, being associated with an adjusted relative risk of 1.6-2.0.
 Other important predictors in both surgical groups were surgical priority, older age, peripheral vascular disease, and higher serum creatinine.
 Although a number of preoperative risk factors could be identified for the development of renal failure, low cardiac output, and requirement for prolonged mechanical support, few risk factors could be identified for the development of mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding.
 This observation suggests that mediastinitis and reoperation for bleeding are more likely the result of technical factors rather than patient-related risk factors.

 Four patients fulfilling the case definition for eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome are described, including one whose disease began in 1986.
 Each displayed a variety of symptoms: one suffered principally from myalgia and recovered spontaneously on discontinuation of L-tryptophan therapy; one exhibited progressive sclerodermiform skin changes, neuropathy, and myopathy; a third had prominent neuromuscular disease and sclerodermiform skin changes; and the fourth experienced profound weight loss, an axonal polyneuropathy, and perivascular lymphoid infiltrates simulating a lymphoma.
 Evidence of T-cell activation was present in peripheral blood and affected tissues during the clinically active progressive phase of disease.
 Among other manifestations pleural effusion, cutaneous vasculitis, joint contractures, and bloody diarrhea were observed.
 A history of L-tryptophan ingestion should be sought in patients with myalgia, fatigue, or the above outlined symptoms.

"Circadian esophageal motor function in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 Effective esophageal peristalsis is a major determinant of esophageal clearance function and may contribute to the development of complications in gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 Using 24-hour ambulatory esophageal manometry, we compared the circadian esophageal motor activity of normal volunteers to that of patients with increased esophageal exposure to gastric juice and various grades of mucosal injury (no mucosal injury, esophagitis, stricture, or Barrett's esophagus).
 The prevalence of a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter, esophageal acid exposure time, and the frequency of nonperistaltic esophageal contractions during the supine, upright, and meal periods increased with increasing severity of mucosal injury.
 The median amplitude of esophageal contractions was compromised only in patients with a mechanically defective sphincter.
 This was particularly so in patients with stricture or Barrett's esophagus and was associated with an increased frequency of ineffective contractions (less than 30 mm Hg).
 These data show that esophageal motor function deteriorates with increasing severity of mucosal injury.
 This appears to be caused by persistent reflux of gastric juice across a mechanically defective lower esophageal sphincter.
 The need for surgical correction of a mechanically defective sphincter before the loss of esophageal body function is implicated.

"Marjolin's ulcer: a review and reevaluation of a difficult problem.
 The formation of an epidermoid carcinoma in nonhealing scar tissue, a Marjolin's ulcer, is a well described neoplasm.
 These lesions are, however, frequently overlooked and often inadequately treated.
 This paper reviews six cases of scar-tissue carcinoma.
 All lesions were secondary to various kinds of burns.
 Four of the Marjolin's ulcers were well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas.
 One was a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, and one was a malignant melanoma.
 The average age at presentation was 59 years, and the mean interval from time of burn injury to appearance of neoplasm was 36.8 years.
 The lesions varied in anatomic location and involved the upper extremities, lower extremities, and scalp.
 In addition to the case studies, this paper reviews the literature and provides a logical treatment plan for a patient with a Marjolin's ulcer.
 Because these lesions can be very aggressive, a well thought-out treatment plan is necessary to optimize care and assure patient survival.

"Serum immunoglobulins E and G anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in patients with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
 Patients with cystic fibrosis frequently have pulmonary colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and develop anti-Af immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies.
 The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in subjects with cystic fibrosis is difficult because of the high incidence of Af colonization, with development of humoral antibody responses.
 In this study, we sequentially measured serum anti-Af IgE (Af-E) and IgG (Af-G) antibodies by ELISA in subjects with cystic fibrosis.
 In subjects with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Af-E and Af-G antibodies were significantly increased when compared with other groups of patients with cystic fibrosis who had positive skin tests or precipitins to Af (or both) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively).
 In addition, increased Af-E and Af-G levels were sometimes seen in other groups, especially subjects with cystic fibrosis who had positive Af skin tests or precipitin tests, two of whom later developed criteria diagnostic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
 Thus, serum Af-E and Af-G levels were quantitatively increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis who had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and thus adjunctive data in diagnosis.
 However, it also suggested that subclinical pulmonary inflammation may also occur.

 The goal of this study was to evaluate the association between menarchal status and diabetic retinopathy.
 Diabetic retinopathy was present in 51 of 129 females; 7 were premenarchal, and 44 were postmenarchal.
 The range of severity of retinopathy was greater in the postmenarchal group.
 In multivariate analyses, duration of diabetes, menarchal status, and diastolic blood pressure were associated with the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy.
 After partitioning the duration of diabetes into years before and years after menarche, both were significant, but the number of years of diabetes after menarche was more strongly associated.
 At a 4-yr follow-up examination, more postmenarchal than premenarchal females had progression of their retinopathy (P = 0.06).
 These data suggest that stage of sexual development, as reflected by menarchal status, is associated with the presence and possibly the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy.

"Aerobic work capacity in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the aerobic work capacity of patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome and compare it with that of two control groups, and to assess the patients' perception of their level of activity before and during illness.
 DESIGN--A symptom limited exercise treadmill test with on line gas analysis and blood sampling was used.
 Subjects were assessed by one investigator, who was blind to the group which they were in.
 SETTING--Department of medicine, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.
 SUBJECTS--13 Patients (10 women, three men) who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Two control groups of similar age, sex, and body weight: 13 normal subjects (10 women, three men) and seven patients (five women, two men) with the irritable bowel syndrome.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Aerobic work capacity as assessed by several variables such as length of time on treadmill, heart rate, and biochemical measurements; Borg score; and visual analogue scores of perceived level of physical activity.
 RESULTS--The patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome had a reduced exercise capacity compared with that of the other subjects, spending a significantly shorter time on the treadmill.
 They had a significantly higher heart rate at submaximal levels of exertion and at stage III exertion had significantly higher blood lactate concentrations.
 Using a Borg score, they showed a significantly altered perception of their degree of physical exertion with a mean score of 8.2 compared with 6.6 and 5.3 for the normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome respectively.
 Using a visual analogue scale they indicated that they had a greater capacity for activity before illness than had the patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, but the scores were not significantly different between the two groups.
 Both groups of patients indicated reduced activity at the time of testing.
 Normal controls and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome aspired to a greater level of activity than their current level, but the patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome aspired to a level similar to that which they had had before their illness.
 CONCLUSIONS--Patients with the chronic fatigue syndrome have reduced aerobic work capacity compared with normal subjects and patients with the irritable bowel syndrome.
 They also have an altered perception of their degree of exertion and their premorbid level of physical activity.

 The authors studied the familial occurrence of tumors in 154 individuals with gastric cancer by reviewing the clinical data and the genealogical tree of all patients registered in 1986 through 1987 in the Local Health Care District of Modena, Italy, for cancer of the stomach.
 Crude and age-adjusted (world population) incidence rates of gastric cancer were 34.0 and 21.4 new cases/100,000/year, respectively, in men, and 24.5 and 10.9 in women, respectively.
 Among first-degree relatives of the registered patients there were 30 cases of gastric carcinoma versus 15 cases in a control group matched for age and sex (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio [M-H OR] 3.14, P less than 0.01).
 This excess of gastric neoplasms was observed in siblings (17 versus 7, M-H OR 4.33, P less than 0.02) but not in parents (13 versus 8, not significant).
 Besides gastric cancer, there was no significant excess of other type of tumors in case families.
 The familial occurrence of gastric cancer tended to be more frequent in patients with ""diffuse"" carcinoma (52%) than in subjects with ""intestinal"" cancer (33%), although the difference was not statistically significant.
 In conclusion, the current investigation suggests that a ""family history"" for gastric neoplasms is usually observed in approximately 10% to 15% of the registered cases.
 As already described for other common malignancies, therefore, the familial occurrence of gastric carcinoma suggests the existence of a genetic susceptibility to cancer of the stomach, at least in a fraction of these patients.

"Cardioprotective effects of carnitine in extensive aortocoronary bypass grafting: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
 The cardioprotective effects of carnitine were tested in patients undergoing multiple aortocoronary bypass grafting.
 Intermittent aortic cross-clamping at 28 degrees C was used.
 Mean total cross-clamping time was 30 +/- 11 min.
 Patients were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving placebo (group 1), a group pretreated with 3 g carnitine intravenously before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (group 2), and a group pretreated with 6 g carnitine intravenously (group 3).
 The markers of myocardial ischemia included levels of adenosine triphosphate, its catabolites, and creatine phosphate in transmural left ventricular biopsy specimens taken at the beginning and end of CPB, as well as hemodynamic recovery during weaning from CPB and for the next 24 h.
 The intravenous infusion of carnitine (3 or 6 g) had no hemodynamic effect.
 At the end of CPB myocardial tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate did not differ significantly among the groups (P greater than 0.05).
 Recovery of cardiac function during weaning from CPB and for the following 24 h was similar in all three groups (P greater than 0.05).
 It is concluded that pretreatment with carnitine neither facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery nor favorably affects hemodynamic function during the next 24 h.

"Usefulness of labetalol in chronic atrial fibrillation.
 Beta-adrenergic blocking agents are useful in controlling excessive ventricular rate in chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) but often reduce exercise capacity.
 To investigate the advantage of labetalol--a unique beta blocker with alpha-blocking property--in chronic AF, 10 patients without underlying structural heart disease were studied with treadmill test, 12-minute walk and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.
 Patients were randomized and crossed over to receive 4 phases of treatment (placebo, digoxin, digoxin with half-dose labetalol, and full-dose labetalol).
 Exercise durations were 14.1 +/- 1.5, 14.2 +/- 1.5, 16.1 +/- 1.1 and 15.6 +/- 1.1 minutes, respectively, indicating that labetalol did not reduce exercise tolerance.
 Although digoxin had no advantage over placebo in controlling maximal heart rate (177 +/- 2 vs 175 +/- 3 beats/min), labetalol, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to digoxin, was advantageous (156 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, and 154 +/- 4 vs 177 +/- 2 beats/min, p less than 0.01, respectively).
 The rate-pressure product was consistently lowered by labetalol at rest and during exercise.
 At peak exercise, the addition of labetalol to digoxin reduced the maximal rate-pressure product achieved from 30,900 +/- 1300 to 24,100 +/- 2,000 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.01) and the maximal rate-pressure product was lowest with full-dose labetalol (22,300 +/- 1,600 mm Hg/min).
 During submaximal exercise on treadmill or during the 12-minute walk, the combination of labetalol and digoxin produced the best heart rate control, whereas labetalol monotherapy was comparable to digoxin therapy.

"Characterization in vitro of a human tumor necrosis factor-binding protein. A soluble form of a tumor necrosis factor receptor.
 Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a pleiotropic mediator of inflammatory responses.
 A cysteine-rich, highly glycosylated 30-kD TNF-binding protein (TNF-BP) purified from urine may have a role in regulation because it protects in vitro against the biological effects of TNF.
 The cytotoxic effect of TNF on the fibrosarcoma cell line WEHI 164 was inhibited by 50% at a 10-fold excess of TNF-BP.
 The binding of TNF to the receptor was partially reversed after the addition of TNF-BP.
 Results from biosynthetic labeling of cells with 35S-cysteine followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-TNF-BP indicated that TNF-BP is formed and released at the cell surface by cleavage because no corresponding cellular polypeptide was observed.
 A cellular 60-kD polypeptide, which was immunoprecipitated with anti-TNF-BP, may correspond to the transmembrane TNF-receptor molecule and be the precursor of TNF-BP.
 Thus, TNF-BP appears to be a soluble form of a transmembrane TNF-receptor.
 Moreover our results demonstrate that the production of TNF-BP is increased when the TNF receptor is downregulated in cells by treatment with TNF or by activation of protein kinase C with phorbol esters.
 TNF-BP may be an important agent that blocks harmful effects of TNF, and, therefore, useful in clinical applications.

"Altered expression of the retinoblastoma gene product in human sarcomas.
 BACKGROUND.
 The retinoblastoma-susceptibility (Rb) gene is a prototype tumor-suppressor gene originally isolated from patients with heritable retinoblastoma.
 This gene encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein whose expression is altered in several types of human tumors.
 METHODS.
 We studied the expression of the Rb protein in 44 primary and 12 metastatic high-grade human sarcomas by means of immunohistochemical methods and Western blotting.
 Computerized image analysis was used to quantify the level of Rb gene product in individual tumor cells.
 The expression of the Rb gene was then correlated with clinical outcome in the patients with primary tumors.
 RESULTS.
 Of the 44 patients with primary sarcomas, 13 (30 percent) had tumors with normal, homogeneous expression of the Rb protein in essentially all tumor cells.
 Thirty-one patients with primary tumors (70 percent) had altered Rb expression; in 18 (40 percent) the Rb protein was heterogeneously expressed, and in 13 (30 percent) it was detected in fewer than 20 percent of the tumor cells.
 All 12 of the patients with metastatic sarcomas had altered expression of the Rb protein.
 When the findings in the patients with primary tumors were correlated with clinical outcome, survival was found to be significantly increased in the patients whose tumors had homogeneous Rb expression, as compared with those with either heterogeneous expression (P = 0.026) or no expression (P = 0.012).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Tumors in which the expression of Rb gene product was decreased were more aggressive than tumors in which this protein was expressed by nearly all cells.
 The Rb gene product may be an important prognostic variable in patients with these tumors.

"24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin after omeprazole treatment and after proximal gastric vagotomy in duodenal ulcer patients 
 The relationship between suppressed gastric acidity and the increase in plasma gastrin levels after pharmacological and surgical treatment of peptic ulcer disease were compared in this study.
 Eight patients with chronic duodenal ulcer and referred for proximal gastric vagotomy were studied.
 24-hour intragastric acidity and plasma gastrin levels were investigated in the same patients on three consecutive occasions: preentry without any treatment; after 4 weeks of administration of 20 mg of omeprazole daily, and 4-6 months after proximal gastric vagotomy.
 Intragastric acidity was slightly more reduced by omeprazole (94%) than after proximal gastric vagotomy (78%), with no difference found during the day or night with either.
 Plasma gastrin levels increased slightly more after proximal gastric vagotomy [284% (median, 2120 pmol.h/L; range, 733-2831 pmol.h/L)] than after omeprazole administration [186% (median, 1586 pmol.h/L; range, 495-2573 pmol.h/L)].
 There is strong evidence that the increased plasma gastrin concentration following omeprazole treatment is caused by the reduced intragastric acidity.
 The slight increase in plasma gastrin concentration following proximal gastric vagotomy despite a lesser reduction in intragastric acidity may be the result of additional effects on gastrin release by the vagotomy.
 Both treatments resulted in a modest increase in plasma levels of gastrin that were far below the gastrin levels observed in achlorhydric patients, e.g., patients with pernicious anemia.

"Ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis for preventing recurrence of surgically treated Crohn's disease. Long-term follow-up of six patients.
 To prevent coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection, an ileocolic nipple valve anastomosis was constructed in six patients with Crohn's disease.
 The patients were observed for more than 7 years and were compared with 21 Crohn patients in whom conventional end-to-end ileocolic anastomosis was performed during the same period.
 The outcome was more favorable in the group with nipple valve anastomosis, i.e., longer interval between surgery and symptomatic relapse, and tendency to less frequent recurrence and re-resection.
 An association was found between radiologically preserved nipple valve and remission, and two patients with intact valve at long-term follow-up remained symptom-free.
 The observations implied that protection of the terminal ileum from coloileal reflux after ileocecal resection for Crohn's disease may favorably influence the prognosis.

"Spontaneous regression of giant arteriovenous fistulae during the perinatal period. Case report.
 A unique case of spontaneous regression of giant arteriovenous fistulae during infancy is described in this report.
 A female infant, the product of normal labor and delivery, demonstrated severe ventriculomegaly and an intracranial hemorrhage at birth.
 Cerebral angiography at 5 days of age revealed several large fistulae fed by the anterior and middle cerebral arteries draining into the deep venous system through a dilated internal cerebral vein and ectatic vein of Galen.
 Two days following the angiogram, a second intracranial hemorrhage occurred.
 Active hydrocephalus developed over the next 6 months and was treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunting.
 When the child was 8 months of age, angiography failed to demonstrate the fistulae.
 It was postulated that pressure effects from the intracranial hematoma and long-standing intracranial hypertension as well as stenosis in the anomalous venous outflow resulted in vascular stasis, venous thrombosis, and selective arterial occlusion.
 Hydrocephalus was a result of the compression of the intraventricular foramina by dilated embryonic vessels.
 This anomaly, predominantly involving the anterior circulation, may be homologous to the vein of Galen aneurysm in the posterior circulation.

"Prospective study of alcohol intake and large bowel cancer.
 The alcohol intake of a cohort of Japanese men in Hawaii is directly and significantly related to the risk of developing rectal cancer, whether assessed on the basis of amount consumed or as a percent of total calories.
 Wine and whiskey are directly related to rectal cancer, but beer is the only alcoholic beverage that displays a statistically significant dose-response (P = 0.008).
 Colon cancer risk also is related directly to alcohol intake, but the association is statistically significant only when measured as a percent of energy intake.
 This suggests that alcohol might displace cancer inhibitors from the diet.
 Calcium, vitamin C, and dietary fiber are inversely related to colon cancer risk in this cohort, and each of these micronutrients displays statistically significant negative correlation with alcohol intake.
 A possible positive association between alcohol and lung cancer was ruled out after adjusting for cigarette smoking.
 Cancers of the prostate and stomach were unrelated to alcohol intake, but the risk of acquiring cancer at all other sites combined was strongly related to alcohol intake.

"Enalapril and renal injury in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Rats of the spontaneously hypertensive strain develop kidney damage that resembles the nephropathy seen in some cases of human essential hypertension.
 Previous studies with a triple drug antihypertensive regimen indicated that proteinuria and glomerular histopathology in spontaneously hypertensive rats might develop despite long-term effective control of systemic blood pressure.
 To investigate further the relation between hypertension and kidney disease, a group of spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril at 15 weeks of age.
 Blood pressure, protein excretion, and kidney function were measured in those rats at regular intervals during the next year and a half and were compared with untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats and the normotensive Wistar-Kyoto parent strain.
 Kidney tissue samples from all three groups, collected at autopsy, were stained by immunohistochemical and conventional methods to assess the relative severity and nature of kidney damage.
 Although enalapril therapy was completely effective in controlling the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats, it only postponed the onset of kidney disease.
 Enalapril-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats eventually exhibited albuminuria as severe as that found in hypertensive rats.
 Kidney vessel pathology was completely prevented with enalapril, but the abnormal accumulation of mononuclear cells in tubulointerstitial and periglomerular sites was the same as in untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 We have concluded that elevated protein excretion in rats of the spontaneously hypertensive rat strain is not a secondary consequence of systemic hypertension.
 Structural abnormalities of renal vessels also do not appear to contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of albuminuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Other explanations must be sought to account for the close link between spontaneous hypertension and kidney damage in this animal model.
 The clear dissociation of kidney disease from systemic hypertension exhibited by spontaneously hypertensive rats may also be relevant for human disease.

"Mapping of a functional autoimmune epitope on the beta 1-adrenergic receptor in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
 The presence and properties of serum autoantibodies against beta-adrenergic receptors in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were studied using synthetic peptides derived from the predicted sequences of the human beta-adrenergic receptors.
 Peptides corresponding to the sequences of the second extracellular loop of the human beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors were used as antigens in an enzyme immunoassay to screen sera from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 42), ischemic heart disease (n = 17), or healthy blood donors (n = 34).
 The sera of thirteen dilated cardiomyopathy patients, none of the ischemic heart disease patients, and four of the healthy controls monospecifically recognized the beta 1-peptide.
 Only affinity-purified antibodies of these patients had a inhibitory effect on radioligand binding to the beta 1 receptor of C6 rat glioma cells.
 They recognized the receptor protein by immunoblot and bound in situ to human myocardial tissue.
 We conclude that a subgroup of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy have in their sera autoantibodies specifically directed against the second extracellular loop of the beta 1-adrenergic receptor.
 These antibodies could serve as a marker of an autoimmune response with physiological and/or pathological implications.

 Inhalation anesthesia first with halothane followed by enflurane relieved a patient with status asthmaticus who was refractory to conventional therapy including mechanical ventilation.
 After 13 days of anesthesia while on mechanical ventilation and employing nondepolarizing muscle relaxants, significant neuromuscular impairment, manifested by tetraplegia and sensory disturbance, developed.
 Anesthesia was discontinued on day 14, and the patient was weaned from mechanical ventilation on day 16.
 Over the next two months, the neuromuscular impairment markedly improved.
 Halothane was associated with cardiac arrhythmias and hepatitis necessitating replacement by enflurane.
 Enflurane appeared to be as effective a treatment for refractory asthma as halothane.
 The most probable cause of the neuromuscular impairment in our patient was the long-term use of inhalation anesthetics or nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

"Tumor cell lines established in vitro: an independent prognostic factor for survival in non-small-cell lung cancer.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between in-vitro establishment of tumor cell lines and survival in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.
 DESIGN: Cohort study.
 SETTING: Single-institution tertiary care center.
 PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with non-small-cell lung cancer from whom a viable tumor specimen could be obtained.
 INTERVENTION: Tumor tissue was removed at the time of entry into a therapeutic protocol.
 The tumor tissue was processed in the laboratory for attempted cell-line establishment.
 Patients classified as potentially curable (stages I, II, and IIIA) were treated with surgical resection, radiation therapy, or a combination.
 Patients suitable for palliative therapy only (stages IIIB and IV) were treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy.
 Chemotherapy was based on in-vitro drug sensitivity when available.
 Cell-line establishment was correlated to clinical outcome.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Univariate analysis of survival was done using the log-rank test; multivariate analysis was done by Cox modeling step-up and step-down techniques.
 Cell lines were established from the tumor specimens of 25 patients (20%).
 Those patients experienced a median survival of 7 months compared with 18 months in patients from whom cell lines could not be established (P less than 0.001).
 In the 61 patients with potentially curable disease, 8 patients (13%) with cell lines established had a median survival of 8 months compared with 32 months for those without cell lines established (P = 0.001).
 In the 62 palliative group patients, the median survival of the 17 patients (27%) from whom tumor cell lines were established was 5 months compared with 7 months for those without cell lines (P = 0.15).
 Multivariate analysis in both groups showed cell-line establishment to be a significant indicator of prognosis (P less than 0.0001 for curable group; P less than 0.01 for palliative group).
 CONCLUSION: In-vitro tumor growth is related to decreased patient survival, which in turn reflects the biologic aggressiveness of cancers giving rise to these tumor cell lines.

"Barotrauma associated with high-frequency jet ventilation for hypoxic salvage.
 Most reports describe reduction in proximal airway pressures with high-frequency jet ventilation.
 This led us to speculate that high-frequency jet ventilation might reduce barotrauma by providing alveolar ventilation at lower airway pressures.
 We describe a group of patients in whom a high incidence of barotrauma was observed after institution of high-frequency jet ventilation despite reduction in measured airway pressures.
 Fifteen hypoxic patients who could not be treated with conventional ventilation and who had no roentgenographic evidence of barotrauma were entered into the study.
 Airway pressures were measured during conventional ventilation and at 2 and 24 hours after high-frequency jet ventilation.
 Despite significant reduction in peak inspiratory and mean airway pressures, pneumothorax developed in seven of the 15 patients, an average of 21 hours after initiation of high-frequency jet ventilation.
 Five patients had bilateral pneumothorax and three developed tension pneumothorax.

"The effect of stem stiffness on femoral bone resorption after canine porous-coated total hip arthroplasty.
 Bilateral noncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) was produced in dogs to determine the effect of stem stiffness on stress-related bone resorption.
 Two porous-coated femoral implants of substantially different stiffnesses were designed for direct comparison.
 One was manufactured from cobalt-chromium (CoCr) alloy, the other from titanium alloy.
 The titanium stem was hollowed out to a wall thickness of 1 mm to further reduce its stiffness.
 The cumulative stiffness differences were about 5.4-fold axially and 3.6-fold in bending and torsion.
 Staged bilateral THA was performed on eight dogs.
 Each dog received a stiff CoCr stem on one side and a flexible titanium stem on the other.
 After death, the femora were removed and processed for undecalcified thin-section histology.
 Bone ingrowth and remodeling were quantified by computer-aided image analysis and compared between stem designs.
 All femoral specimens showed bone ingrowth fixation of both stiff and flexible stems along the implant length.
 Tetracycline labeling indicated active bone turnover in the femoral cortex and in regions of ingrowth.
 However, gross differences in femoral bone remodeling were observed both roentgenographically and histologically.
 Femora with the flexible stems consistently showed much less bone resorption than those with the stiff stems.
 Quantitative analysis of paired cross-sections indicated an average of 25%-35% more cortical bone area in the femora with flexible stems.
 Severe resorption of the cortex in the midstem region occurred in three of the femora with the stiff stems but in none with the flexible stems.
 Stem stiffness strongly influences bone remodeling.
 The flexible stem results in more uniform load transfer and less stress shielding.

"Neonatal facial and cry responses to invasive and non-invasive procedures.
 Evaluation of pain in neonates is difficult due to their limited means of communication.
 The aim was to determine whether behavioural reactions of cry and facial activity provoked by an invasive procedure could be discriminated from responses to non-invasive tactile events.
 Thirty-six healthy full-term infants (mean age 2.2 h) received 3 procedures in counterbalanced order: intramuscular injection, application of triple dye to the umbilical stub, and rubbing thigh with alcohol.
 Significant effects of procedure were found for total face activity and latency to face movement.
 A cluster of facial actions comprised of brow bulging, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the naso-labial furrow and open mouth was associated most frequently with the invasive procedure.
 Comparisons between the 2 non-invasive procedures showed more facial activity to thigh swabbing and least to application of triple dye to the umbilical cord.
 Acoustic analysis of cry showed statistically significant differences across procedures only for latency to cry and cry duration for the group as a whole.
 However, babies who cried to two procedures showed higher pitch and greater intensity to the injection.
 There were no significant differences in melody, dysphonation, or jitter.
 Methodological difficulties for investigators in this area were examined, including criteria for the selection of cries for analysis, and the logical and statistical challenges of contrasting cries induced by different conditions when some babies do not always cry.
 It was concluded that facial expression, in combination with short latency to onset of cry and long duration of first cry cycle typifies reaction to acute invasive procedures.

"Early hospital discharge of children with cancer treated for fever and neutropenia: identification and management of the low-risk patient.
 Children with leukemia and solid tumors are often hospitalized for empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy because of fever during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.
 Conventional practice dictates that parenteral antibiotics be continued until the patient is afebrile and has recovered from neutropenia, ie, until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) exceeds 500 cells per cubic millimeter.
 However, the practice in our center has been to discontinue parenteral antibiotic therapy and discharge many such patients before resolution of neutropenia.
 Since the feasibility and safety of this approach has not been studied, we reviewed the records of 114 consecutive hospitalizations for fever and neutropenia in 61 patients during a 13-month period.
 Seventy-seven children (68%) were discharged to their homes while still neutropenic after they had been afebrile for 1 to 2 days on parenteral antibiotics, had negative blood cultures, appeared well, and usually had some evidence of bone marrow recovery.
 Five patients (4.4%) developed recurrent fever and required rehospitalization within 7 days of discharge.
 Only three of the 77 patients (3.9%) who were sent home with neutropenia had recurrent fever.
 Each had a brief and uneventful second hospitalization.
 Two of the 37 children discharged with an ANC over 500 cells per cubic millimeter required rehospitalization.
 A declining ANC and advanced malignancy were risk factors in predicting recurrence of fever following discharge.
 A rising monocyte count was a predictor of imminent recovery from neutropenia.
 These results suggest that ""early"" discharge of an afebrile yet still neutropenic patient is safe when the patient is in remission, has no evidence of serious infection, appears clinically stable, and has indications of bone marrow recovery.
 The conventional approach of routinely continuing the hospitalization until resolution of neutropenia may be unnecessary in such low-risk patients.

"Cardiac calcific deposits in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: preliminary results of a prospective echocardiographic study.
 To explain the incidence and significance of mitral and aortic valve calcification and calcific deposits in the myocardium, a prospective echocardiographic study was performed with 21 consecutive patients who had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) and with 21 age- and sex-matched control subjects with normocalcemia.
 Calcific deposits in the myocardium were seen in 13 patients (62%) with PHP, mainly in the interventicular septum, and in one control subject.
 Aortic valve calcification was observed in 12 patients (57%) with PHP and in one control subject.
 Calcification of the mitral valve was found in seven patients with PHP (33%) and three controls (14%).
 Calcification led to mild or moderate stenosis of the aortic valve in three patients with PHP and of the mitral valve in two patients with PHP.
 No stenosis was found in the subjects in the control group.
 Both calcification of the aortic and mitral valves and calcific deposits in the myocardium are common in patients with PHP and can be detected noninvasively by echocardiography.
 Because of the potential relationship of elevated calcium, calcification, and valvular heart disease, clinical evaluation of PHP should include echocardiographic studies before surgery is performed and during follow-up examination.

"High-fat semielemental diet in the treatment of protracted diarrhea of infancy.
 The capacity for greater fat absorption relative to carbohydrate absorption in protracted diarrhea of infancy was studied in a developed and a developing country (Buffalo, NY, and Bangkok, Thailand).
 Fifty patients with protracted diarrhea in the first year of life (defined as liquid stools of more than 20 mL/kg per day with more than a 14-day duration) were randomly assigned to receive either a standard semielemental diet (Pregestimil) or a high-fat semielemental diet that contained 40% more fat.
 The increased fat was largely in the form of medium-chain triglycerides, with the new diet providing 60% of the fat as medium-chain triglycerides compared with 40% in the standard diet.
 Tolerance to both diets was good in both studies.
 Both groups showed adequate weight gain and an improvement in anthropometric and biochemical parameters.
 The patients receiving the high-fat diet showed no initial weight loss, however, and their weight gain was initiated earlier.
 Cumulative weight gain was also higher in the group receiving the high-fat semielemental diet.
 Fecal fat analyses were performed after 1 week of therapy.
 There was no difference observed in the coefficient of fat absorption between the groups receiving the two formulas, indicating that infants with protracted diarrhea may be able to tolerate a higher fat intake than is normally provided.
 As carbohydrate intolerance is known to be a complicating factor when using semielemental enteral feeds for infants with protracted diarrhea, a higher-fat semielemental diet may be the most appropriate way to provide adequate caloric intake.

"Probe angioplasty of total coronary occlusion using the Probing Catheter technique.
 Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of total coronary occlusion is limited by the inability of guidewires and conventional dilating catheters to cross all such lesions.
 A new technique was therefore prospectively evaluated for PTCA of these lesions using the ultra-low-profile Probe ""balloon on a wire"" device.
 An intracoronary Probing Catheter was used to facilitate crossing the stenosis with a guidewire and then to deliver a Probe into the obstruction for balloon dilatation.
 This technique was utilized in 64 consecutive patients with ""absolute"" coronary occlusions demonstrating no angiographically detectable antegrade coronary flow.
 Successful dilatation was achieved in 47 (73%).
 Among 33 occlusions of less than 3 mo duration 31 (94%) were successfully dilated whereas only 16 of 31 more chronic occlusions were dilated (P less than .01).
 Chronic occlusions with a tapered morphology and those located more than 1 cm from a branch point were more frequently dilatable.
 There were no serious complications including no vessel perforations with this technique.
 The Probing Catheter technique offers a safe and effective method for the dilatation of recent coronary occlusions by using balloon on a wire technology.

"Prospective evaluation of gastric emptying in the self-poisoned patient.
 The authors prospectively studied the effect of gastric emptying (GE) and activated charcoal (AC) upon clinical outcome in acutely self-poisoned patients.
 Presumed overdose patients (n = 808) were treated using an alternate day protocol based on a 10-question cognitive function examination and presenting vital sign parameters.
 Asymptomatic patients (n = 451) did not receive GE.
 AC was administered to asymptomatic patients only on even days.
 GE in the remaining symptomatic patients (n = 357) was performed only on even days.
 On emptying days, alert patients had ipecac-induced emesis while obtunded patients received gastric lavage.
 AC therapy followed gastric emptying.
 On nonemptying days, symptomatic patients were treated only with AC.
 No clinical deterioration occurred in the asymptomatic patients treated without GE.
 AC use did not alter outcome measures in asymptomatic patients.
 GE procedures in symptomatic patients did not significantly alter the length of stay in the emergency department, mean length of time intubated, or mean length of stay in the intensive care unit.
 Gastric lavage was associated with a higher prevalence of medical intensive care unit admissions (P = .0001) and aspiration pneumonia (P = .0001).
 The data support the management of selected acute overdose patients without GE and fail to show a benefit from AC in asymptomatic overdose patients.

"Pelvic pain and infections.
 Infectious etiologies of both acute and chronic pelvic pain are common and may involve multiple organ systems.
 In the evaluation of the acute pain, it is important to remember that rapidity of diagnosis is important because of the possibility of significant morbidity and even death if a condition is not attended to rapidly.
 In recent years, laparoscopic evaluation of the pelvis has provided a better understanding of the pathophysiology of some of these infections, as well as possible therapeutic maneuvers.
 The evaluation of chronic pelvic pain requires a thorough attempt at careful diagnosis with minds open to the possibility that other organ systems besides the genital tract may be involved.
 Laparoscopy also may be an important diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the evaluation of the sequelae of pelvic inflammation leading to chronic pelvic pain.
 All therapeutic modalities that are instituted on the basis of the diagnostic evaluation must take into consideration that a strong emotional component is generally associated with chronic pelvic pain.
 Such components must be addressed in order to achieve the best possible results for the patient.

"Expression of aminopeptidase N (CD13) in mesenchymal tumors.
 For a long time, CD13 molecules have been considered to be restricted to myeloid cells and related neoplasms.
 Meanwhile, however, expression of CD13 has also been detected in some hepatocellular, gallbladder, renal, and lung carcinomas, and even in some fibrosarcomas and malignant melanomas.
 In this study, expression of CD13 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, along with 33 benign and 83 malignant mesenchymal tumors (MET) using CD13 monoclonal antibodies (MAb) My7, U71, WM-15, and MoU48.
 In non-neoplastic mesenchymal cells, expression of CD13 was restricted to perivascular fibrocytes/blasts, tissue histiocytes, osteoclasts, and to the perineurium of peripheral nerve trunks.
 Under neoplastic conditions, CD13 was detectable in some tumors of smooth muscle, fibrous, fibrohistiocytic, synovial, osteogenic, and peripheral nerve sheath origin, and even in some tumors of adipose tissue.
 Tumors of striated muscle origin, of autonomic ganglia, and of cartilage-forming tissues were CD13-negative throughout.
 Thus in most but not all tumors studied the pattern of expression of CD13 mirrors the situation found in their cells of origin.
 These findings enrich the data on expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in extra-hematopoietic tissues.
 Expression of CD13, which meanwhile is known to be identical to aminopeptidase N, an important peptide-cleaving enzyme, in only some MET might reflect a special functional state of these neoplasms.

"Femoral artery cannulation for monitoring in critically ill children: prospective study.
 Seventy-seven attempted percutaneous femoral artery cannulations were prospectively evaluated in 74 children.
 Artery cannulation was successfully accomplished in 73 (95%) cases and lasted for a mean of 6 days.
 Sixty percent of the catheters were inserted on the first attempt.
 Fifty-two (71%) patients weighed less than 10 kg and 55 (75%) patients were less than 12 months old.
 Fifty-one (70%) patients received inotropic support at the time of cannulation, and 27 (37%) eventually died from causes unrelated to catheter insertion.
 There was one episode each of line-associated infection and transient distal ischemia not resulting in tissue loss, and two episodes of catheter malfunction.
 In eight (11%) patients, signs of distal vascular insufficiency developed shortly catheter placement and resolved after catheter removal.
 The development of this complication correlated significantly (p less than .05) with younger age (5.5 vs.
 22.3 months).
 We conclude that femoral artery cannulation has a high degree of success in very small, critically ill children.
 It should be considered an acceptable alternative to small-vessel cannulation when the latter is not technically achievable, or in the unstable patient where rapid establishment of reliable arterial access is necessary.

"Morphological findings contributing to a failed Fontan procedure. Twelve-year experience.
 A group of 37 patients (age range, 3 months to 29 years) who died after the modified Fontan procedure (within 2 months), representing 15% of the 245 patients undergoing this procedure from 1976 through 1988, was reviewed to determine the causes of death.
 The three morphological groups were 1) univentricular atrioventricular connection (n = 19), 2) tricuspid atresia (n = 9), and 3) other complex malformations (n = 9).
 Subaortic stenosis was present in 15 patients (40%) in this group compared with 31 of 208 early survivors (15%) (p = 0.008).
 Pulmonary artery banding, identified as a risk factor in our previous experience, was performed in 14 patients, nine of whom had subaortic stenosis.
 Nine palliative procedures for subaortic stenosis were performed in eight patients--before the Fontan procedure in three patients and concurrently with the Fontan procedure in five patients.
 Myocardial hypertrophy and signs of acute ischemic injury were common findings at autopsy (n = 25) and were particularly prominent in all patients with univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology associated with subaortic stenosis and previous pulmonary artery banding (n = 7).
 We conclude that the present majority of deaths occurring after the modified Fontan procedure are myocardial in nature and attributable to advanced myocardial hypertrophy that is potentiated by previous pulmonary artery banding and subaortic stenosis.

"Nitrous oxide and epinephrine-induced arrhythmias.
 We asked whether the sympathomimetic effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) predisposed patients receiving N2O to arrhythmias in response to epinephrine administration.
 We also asked whether aging contributed to the development of arrhythmias, with or without N2O.
 One hundred patients having transsphenoidal hypophysectomy were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia including (n = 49) or excluding (n = 51) N2O.
 All patients were given an injection of epinephrine 1:200,000, with 0.5% lidocaine to produce hemostasis.
 Using intermittent 12-lead and continuous lead II electrocardiography, we determined the incidence of premature ventricular contraction, isorhythmic atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, and changes in T-wave morphology.
 Patients given N2O had a significantly higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation (61.2% vs 41.2%).
 A trend toward a higher incidence of multiple premature ventricular contractions (16.3% vs 7.8%) was not statistically significant.
 Both anesthetic groups had a high incidence of postoperative changes in T-wave morphology (46.9% in the N2O group vs 50.9% in the group not given N2O).
 Aging alone did not affect the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats, isorhythmic AV dissociation, or changes in electrocardiographic morphology, but correlated with the development of ventricular ectopy during N2O anesthesia.
 We conclude that the use of N2O correlated with a higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation in response to injection of epinephrine with lidocaine.

"Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms.
 Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported.
 No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery.
 Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing.
 The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter.
 One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported.
 The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported).
 Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival.

"Premorphological metabolic changes in human breast carcinogenesis.
 Malignant breast tissue is characterized by morphological and metabolic changes when compared with normal breast tissue.
 In this study, the cytochemical measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was used to detect abnormal metabolism in breast tissue and to determine whether abnormal metabolic activity precedes morphological change during human breast carcinogenesis.
 Normal and benign breast tissue, morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts, and malignant breast tissue were studied.
 In malignant tissue, mean(s.e.m.) G6PD activity was significantly increased when compared with normal and benign tissue (9.69(2.3) versus 27.02(1.7) mean integrated extinction (MIE) x 100, P less than 0.01).
 G6PD activity was increased in morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts when compared with normal and benign breast tissue from breasts with no known cancer (27.02(1.7) versus 18.42(2.6) MIE x 100, P less than 0.05).
 These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities precede morphological changes in breast carcinogenesis.
 Abnormal metabolism can be detected widely within a cancer-containing breast.
 The detection of such abnormality may prove helpful in identifying patients at high risk of developing breast cancer.

"Family recovery after vascular surgery.
 Twenty-one families were observed in a 3-month study to assess family coping with major vascular surgery and recovery.
 Analysis of family measures data (the Family APGAR, the Family Inventory of Resource for Management, and the Family Crisis Oriented Personal Evaluation Scales) was combined with grounded theory method to assess family responses over time and recovery outcomes.
 Containment emerged as the major conceptual category of the grounded theory.
 Containment refers to a constellation of constructed meanings for events and behavioral responses used by families to regulate the impact of the surgical crisis and reduce family disruption.
 This ""contained"" coping pattern was manifested in families' avoidant behaviors and narrow definitions of the problem: that is, they defined their situation in terms of the surgical repair as cure rather than palliative intervention for a chronic, progressive disease.
 Situational factors such as the insidious development of the illness and the primary focus of care providers in the hospital on surgical care (allowing families' narrow definitions of their situation to remain unchallenged) also contributed to containment.
 Containment resulted in poor risk factor management as a major recovery outcome.
 Isolation and family conflict were evident throughout the recovery period.
 Concerns generated by continued evidence of morbidity during recovery contributed to a developing awareness of underlying disease, and diminishing containment when this growing awareness was openly shared within the family.
 Significant findings of the family measures analysis were compared with the grounded theory of the qualitative data.
 Each corroborated the other in key dimensions.

 The results of nonoperative treatment of 72 patients with complete anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears, documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy, were evaluated.
 All patients had an acute injury with hemarthrosis in a previously normal knee.
 Patients having meniscal repair were excluded as were those with collateral or posterior cruciate ligament tears or associated fractures.
 Treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and bracing.

"Hemodynamic and metabolic effects of dobutamine in 18 patients after open heart surgery.
 Low cardiac output syndrome frequently follows cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) surgery.
 In the present study, we used dobutamine to increase cardiac index (CI) and oxygen delivery (DO2) in 18 patients after open heart surgery.
 Using increasing doses of dobutamine up to 10 micrograms/kg.min-1, we observed statistically significant (p less than .01) increases in mean CI (2.50 +/- 0.10 to 3.56 +/- 0.18 L/min.m2) and in mean heart rate (HR) (83 +/- 3 to 105 +/- 3 beat/min).
 Mean systemic vascular resistance index decreased significantly (p less than .01) in all patients (2271 +/- 101 to 1648 +/- 83 dyne.sec/cm5.m2).
 Pulmonary vascular resistance index did not change in the ten coronary artery bypass graft patients, but decreased significantly (p less than .01) in the eight valve replacement patients (561 +/- 98 to 421 +/- 79 dyne.sec/cm5.m2).
 Mean DO2 increased in all patients, although there was no concomitant increase in oxygen consumption (VO2) in four patients.
 We observed a significant (p less than .01) increase in mean VO2 in the remaining 14 patients (110 +/- 6 to 148 +/- 12 ml/min.m2), in spite of significant decreases in PaO2 and increases in right-to-left intrapulmonary shunting.
 Although increases in HR and ventricular arrhythmias may limit its use, dobutamine increases CI and DO2 in patients after CPB.
 In the present study, dobutamine's varying metabolic effect exemplifies the need for close monitoring of hemodynamic and metabolic variables when using vasoactive drugs in the postoperative period.

"Advanced protein glycosylation induces transendothelial human monocyte chemotaxis and secretion of platelet-derived growth factor: role in vascular disease of diabetes and aging.
 Diabetes and aging are commonly accompanied by arterio- and atherosclerosis.
 Infiltration of the arterial subendothelial intima by macrophages/monocytes is an important early event preceding the development of atheromatous lesions; these macrophages are known to produce mitogenic factors in early atherosclerotic lesions.
 It has been previously shown that, over time, vascular matrix accumulates proteins nonenzymatically modified by advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs).
 In view of the fact that macrophages/monocytes have AGE-specific receptors associated with the expression of several growth factors, we investigated the possibility that AGEs mediate initial monocyte-vessel wall interactions that occur before overt formation of vascular lesions.
 This study demonstrates that (i) in vitro- and in vivo-formed AGEs are chemotactic for human blood monocytes, (ii) sub-endothelial AGEs can selectively induce monocyte migration across an intact endothelial cell monolayer, and (iii) subsequent monocyte interaction with AGE-containing matrix results in the expression of platelet-derived growth factor.
 These results support the existing hypothesis that in vivo-forming glucose-derived protein adducts can act as signals for the normal turnover of senescent tissue protein by means of the AGE-specific receptor system.
 Time-dependent glucose-induced deposition of AGEs on matrix proteins may promote monocyte infiltration into the subendothelium.
 Subsequent AGE-triggered macrophage activation and consequent elaboration of proliferative factors may normally coordinate remodeling but may also lead to the diverse pathogenic changes typical of arterio- and atherosclerosis in diabetic or aging populations.

"Mineralogic parameters related to amosite asbestos-induced fibrosis in humans.
 We have previously shown that in the lungs of a group of chrysotile miners and millers, grade of interstitial fibrosis (asbestosis) is directly proportional to tremolite fiber or chrysotile fiber concentration but is inversely proportional to mean fiber length and length-related parameters.
 To compare the effects of the commercial amphibole asbestos amosite on parenchymal fibrosis, we histologically graded fibrosis in four different sites in the lungs of 20 shipyard and insulation workers with heavy amosite exposure and measured by analytic electron microscopy fiber concentration and size in corresponding portions of lung tissue.
 Fibrosis grade was found to be strongly positively correlated with amosite concentration and negatively correlated with mean fiber size parameters, including fiber length, width, surface area, and mass.
 A comparison of our present results with our data on the chrysotile miners and millers showed that the regression lines of fibrosis grade versus concentration for amosite, chrysotile, and tremolite were statistically different.
 These findings indicate that amosite concentration, like chrysotile and tremolite concentration, is closely and directly related to fibrosis at the local lung level.
 Furthermore, these observations again raise the possibility that short fibers may be more important than is commonly believed in the genesis of fibrosis in man.
 Last, the concentration comparison data indicate that, fiber for fiber, amosite is more fibrogenic than is chrysotile or tremolite, and indirectly suggest that tremolite is more fibrogenic than is chrysotile.

"Relation between transcardiac and transthoracic current during defibrillation in humans.
 Conceptually, transthoracic defibrillation threshold current can be considered a function of at least two quantities.
 It is directly proportional to the transcardiac threshold current and inversely proportional to the transcardiac current fraction (FC) or the ratio of transcardiac and transthoracic current.
 Although experimental and theoretical estimates of FC have been as high as 45%, previous measurements in humans have not been made.
 This study was designed to quantify FC in humans.
 During intraoperative testing of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator, transthoracic rescue shocks of 200-400 J were delivered when the device failed to defibrillate.
 Simultaneous transthoracic voltage (VT) and transcardiac voltage (VC) between two implanted epicardial patch electrodes were measured.
 The ratio, VC/VT, was 0.04 +/- 0.03 (mean +/- SD) in 10 patients.
 In 16 dogs, a comparison was made between direct measurement of FC and VC/VT.
 FC was determined with a specially designed electrode system, which was calibrated to account for field distortion introduced by the electrodes.
 There was no significant difference between FC and VC/VT, which were both approximately 0.05, suggesting that VC/VT was statistically equivalent to FC.
 The results of this study, therefore, indicate that during transthoracic defibrillation in humans, approximately 4% of transthoracic current traverses the heart.
 This relatively small percentage of current results from the existence of parallel pathways, such as the thoracic cage and lungs, which shunt current around the heart.

"Autoradiographic evaluation of monoclonal antibodies' access to melanoma-associated antigens in melanoma xenografts.
 Autoradiography of nude mice bearing human malignant melanoma xenografts was performed to characterize the distribution pattern of radioiodinated anti-melanoma monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) and fragments in macroscopic tumor nodules.
 Non-uniformity of radioactivity distribution was seen in all MoAb-xenograft combinations.
 The predominant patterns were marked deposition of radioactivity either in the periphery of nodules or in sharply delimited intra-tumoral foci.
 These patterns were generated by limitations in the accessibility of melanoma tissue rather than gross necrosis or heterogeneity of antigen expression.
 Computer-aided densitometry of autoradiograms was used to elaborate the difference of accumulation in intra-tumoral hot spots versus cold areas.
 It was found that increasing uniformity was achieved by increasing the dose of MoAb (i.e., intact IgG) injected, whereas a reduction in the size of MoAb (IgG greater than F(ab')2 greater than Fab) showed no such effect.

"Aminoglycosides: assessing the potential for nephrotoxicity.
 Although aminoglycosides have been a mainstay of antibiotic therapy in postsurgical infections, certain patients may be at risk for potential aminoglycoside induced toxicities.
 Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is one of the most frequent causes of iatrogenic renal failure.
 A narrow toxicity to therapeutic ratio, a relatively long serum half-life and concentration in the renal cortex all contribute to renal dysfunction.
 Patients at greatest risk for aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity include the elderly, patients with pre-existing renal disease and those who are volume depleted.

 T2-weighted (0.5 T) magnetic resonance images were used to study the prevalence of subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMHIs) in 22 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), 20 age-matched older healthy control subjects, and 10 younger healthy control subjects.
 Exclusionary criteria for all groups included cerebrovascular risk factors.
 All subjects had Hachinski Ischemic Index scores of less than 2 and computed tomographic scans showing no infarct.
 The WMHIs were classified as periventricular WMHIs or deep WMHIs and graded 0 through 3 (0 indicated absent, and 3, severe).
 For the group with DAT and older control subjects, periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs were graded 2 or 3 in fewer than 17% and 27% of subjects, respectively, whereas in the younger control subjects, all ratings were grade 1 or less.
 Serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure values, although within the normal range, were elevated significantly in older control subjects when compared with those in younger control subjects.
 No significant differences in WMHI ratings, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglyceride levels were found between patients with DAT and age-matched control subjects.
 Systolic blood pressure levels correlated with the severity of periventricular WMHIs only in older control subjects.
 Age correlated with periventricular WMHIs and deep WMHIs within both the older control subjects and the patients with DAT.
 There was no significant correlation between WMHIs and the severity of dementia in the group with DAT.
 These results suggest that, in subjects screened for cerebrovascular risk factors, WMHIs are rare and occur with identical frequency in patients with DAT as in age-matched healthy control subjects.

 The prognostic value of four clinical variables (age and sex of patients, association with myasthenia gravis, and clinical stage) and histological type was analyzed in 83 consecutive patients with thymoma, histologically classified as cortical, medullary, and mixed.
 Age, sex, and association with myasthenia gravis did not prove to represent significant prognostic factors; clinical stage and histological type, on the contrary, had a highly significant prognostic value (p less than 0.001).
 A model of clinicopathological staging, based on both clinical stage and histological type, in which three major prognostic groups are considered is proposed.
 The degree of significance of this model is higher (p less than 0.0001) than that of clinical stage and histological type considered individually; its validity is further supported by the results of multivariate analysis according to the Cox regression model (p = 0.0001).

"Matched group study of surgical resection versus cobalt-60 plaque radiotherapy for primary choroidal or ciliary body melanoma.
 We report the results of a nonrandomized, matched-group, survival and visual preservation study of patients with a choroidal or ciliary body melanoma managed by microsurgical resection of the tumor versus cobalt-60 episcleral plaque radiotherapy.
 Each treatment group consisted of 30 patients.
 All patients were matched on a case-by-case basis in terms of tumor size (largest linear tumor dimension), location of the anterior tumor margin relative to the ora serrata, location of the posterior tumor margin relative to the equator, and age at the time of treatment.
 Although the estimated actuarial 5-year survival probability was slightly greater in the resection group (85.2%) than in the cobalt plaque group (81.8%), this difference was neither clinically impressive nor statistically significant.
 In contrast, there was a substantially higher rate of early posttreatment severe visual loss in the resection group (P = .0008, Mantel-Haenszel test).

"Antenatal spontaneous perforation of the extrahepatic biliary tree.
 Spontaneous perforation of the biliary system is an unusual neonatal phenomenon that is rarely recognized at birth.
 To date, it has not been reported antenatally.
 A 16-year-old pregnant adolescent had an ultrasonogram at 25 weeks of pregnancy that revealed ascites in the fetus.
 After the infant was delivered at 32 weeks, a hepato-iminodiacetic acid scan showed a spontaneous rupture of the common bile duct.
 The infant was treated with external drainage of the biliary tree and recovered well.
 This case demonstrates that spontaneous perforations of the bile ducts can occur much earlier than the usually described 2 to 12 weeks after birth, can be diagnosed antenatally, and should be added to the list of causes of fetal ascites.

"Uremic pruritus in patients on hemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The role of plasma histamine and skin mast cells.
 Fifty-four uremic patients (26 patients were maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD] and 28 on hemodialysis [HD]) were screened for pruritus and plasma histamine.
 50% of the patients on CAPD and 64.3% of patients on HD complained of current itching.
 The extent of itch, assessed by a score, was not significantly different between HD and CAPD patients.
 Plasma histamine levels showed no significant difference between CAPD and HD patients and no correlation between plasma histamine level and the extent of pruritus could be demonstrated.
 In six patients on CAPD and 9 patients on HD plasma histamine levels were determined before and three months after initiation of dialysis treatment; no substantial change could be observed.
 In some patients skin biopsies were obtained from the gluteal region in order to determine the number of skin mast cells.
 The number of mast cells did not show a significant difference between controls (n = 12), uremic patients before initiation of dialysis treatment (n = 8), patients on CAPD (n = 11) and patients on HD (n = 13).
 There was no relationship between the level of plasma histamine, the number of skin mast cells and the extent of pruritus in uremic patients.

"Hyperparathyroidism and cellular mechanisms of gastric acid secretion.
 Patients with hyperparathyroidism appear to be a particular risk for peptic ulcer disease.
 To test the hypothesis that hypercalcemia or parathyroid hormone plays a role in promoting ulcer disease, we studied the effect of varying concentrations of extracellular calcium on acid secretion using in vitro isolated rabbit gastric glands.
 Acid secretion was assessed by the accumulation of carbon 14-labeled aminopyrine (14C-AP).
 Glands were incubated with varying calcium concentrations in the unstimulated state and with histamine or carbachol (10(-7) to 10(-4) mol/L) in 1 or 2 mmol/L calcium medium.
 The effect of parathyroid hormone was also examined under identical conditions.
 Compared to 1 mmol/L standard calcium medium, unstimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly inhibited (p less than 0.05) at both lower (0.33 mmol/L) and higher (2 and 2.5 mmol/L) calcium concentrations.
 Accumulation of 14C-AP in response to histamine stimulation was unaffected by alteration of extracellular calcium (p greater than 0.2).
 Carbachol-stimulated 14C-AP accumulation was significantly augmented (p less than 0.01) by an increase in calcium concentration from 1 to 2 mmol/L.
 The addition of parathyroid hormone (10(-7) to 10(-4) mmol/L) alone or in combination with carbachol or histamine (10(-6) mmol/L) incubation did not alter 14C-AP accumulation.
 These data suggest that elevations in extracellular calcium play an active role in the potentiation of cholinergic-mediated gastric gland acid secretion and may thereby play a role in hyperparathyroid-related ulcer disease.

"Dietary Ca2+ prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats by a sympatholytic mechanism.
 The current study tested the hypothesis that dietary Ca2+ supplementation reverses the NaCl-sensitive component of hypertension and the associated neurochemical abnormalities in the NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-S).
 Male SHR-S were begun on one of four diets at 8 weeks of age: control (0.75% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high NaCl (8.00% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high Ca2+ (0.75% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+); and high NaCl/high Ca2+ (8.00% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+).
 High NaCl SHR-S (X2 weeks) had higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (161 +/- 4 mm Hg) than controls (149 +/- 3 mm Hg; P less than .05).
 Supplementation with Ca2+ prevented the rise in MAP in high NaCl rats, but did not alter MAP in controls.
 The 8% NaCl diet elevated plasma norepinephrine and reduced anterior hypothalamic (AHA) norepinephrine stores and turnover; concomitant Ca2+ supplementation restored both plasma norepinephrine and AHA norepinephrine turnover to normal.
 Clonidine was microinjected into the AHA of rats maintained on the four diets for 2 weeks to test the hypothesis that dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the previously observed NaCl-induced upregulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in AHA.
 Clonidine caused dose-dependent decreases in MAP that were greater in high NaCl rats than in controls.
 The Ca2+ supplementation prevented the exaggerated depressor response to clonidine in the high NaCl group, but not in the controls.
 The Ca2+ supplementation had no effect on pretreatment MAP or on MAP responses to clonidine in control NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.
 Thus, dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the NaCl-induced exacerbation of hypertension and augmented depressor response to clonidine in SHR-S by increasing noradrenergic input to AHA, thereby preventing the upregulation of AHA alpha 2-adrenoceptors.

"Botulism among Alaska Natives. The role of changing food preparation and consumption practices.
 Alaska Natives have one of the highest rates of food-borne botulism worldwide.
 All outbreaks have been associated with the consumption of native foods, but in recent years outbreaks have occurred in previously unaffected areas and have involved new food items.
 Five botulism outbreaks occurred between 1975 and 1985 in an area of southwestern Alaska without previous confirmed outbreaks and among one ethnic group, the Yupik Eskimo.
 Of the 5 outbreaks, 3 were associated with fermented beaver tail, a nontraditional native food recently introduced into the region.
 Preparation techniques vary widely within villages and among ethnic groups.
 Traditional fermentation techniques have changed over the past 50 years; current preparation methods used by some families and ethnic groups may be more favorable for Clostridium botulinum growth.
 Prevention efforts should be targeted at high-risk subgroups of Alaska Natives who appear to have modified traditional practices and increased their risk of food-borne botulism.

 During the first treatment period, oxybutynin reduced the frequency of voiding by 35%, compared with 9% for placebo.
 Oxybutynin gave a significantly greater improvement than placebo in volume at the first desire to void (70 ml increase versus 7.7 ml), maximum filling-phase detrusor pressure (17 cm H2O reduction versus no benefit) and cystometric capacity (104 ml increase versus 7.0 ml).
 A marked oxybutynin carry-over effect was seen during the second treatment period.

"Lewis system alterations in gastric carcinogenesis.
 Alterations in the expression of type 1 blood group-related antigens (Lewis a and b) were examined immunohistochemically in 371 consecutives gastric biopsy and 80 surgical specimens from patients of gastric carcinoma.
 The ABH and Lewis phenotype and secretor status of the patients were correlated with histologic findings.
 An anomalous expression of Lewis a antigen was found in 88 of 249 gastric biopsy specimens of Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients.
 The prevalence of this anomaly increased with the evolution of the premalignant process, in agreement with the commonly accepted model of gastric carcinogenesis.
 Thus, anomalous Lewis a antigen appeared in 66.6% of gastric dysplasia cases, in 64.6% of intestinal metaplasia, in 15.4% of atrophic gastritis, and in 7.4% of superficial gastritis.
 No alterations were found in subjects with normal gastric mucosa.
 Forty-seven of the 49 Lewis (a-b+) phenotype gastric carcinoma patients showed antigenic alterations in tumor cells (anomalous Lewis a antigen in 36 and loss of Lewis antigens in 11).
 In 26 of these gastric specimens an anomalous Lewis a antigen was present in areas of intestinal metaplasia and/or dysplasia away from the area of neoplastic transformation.
 The expression of Lewis a antigen in Lewis (a-b+) phenotype patients is a frequent phenomenon in gastric neoplastic cells and could result from the blocked synthesis of Lewis b antigen with accumulation of its precursors.
 These findings suggest that, during gastric carcinogenesis, antigenic alterations may precede neoplastic transformation.
 An anomalous Lewis a antigen could constitute a significant index of severity of the histologic lesion and contribute to identifying high-risk individuals.

"Reduction in bleeding after heart-lung transplantation. The importance of posterior mediastinal hemostasis.
 To reduce perioperative hemorrhage following heart-lung transplantation, several technical modifications were introduced in June 1988 to secure better posterior mediastinal hemostasis.
 The intraoperative and postoperative use of blood and blood products, as well as the chest tube drainage in the first 24 hours postoperatively, were compared in the seven patients operated on since June 1988 with the nine patients operated on before that date.
 Significant (p less than 0.05) reductions were demonstrated in the intraoperative and postoperative transfusion of packed cells, in the postoperative administration of fresh frozen plasma, and in the chest tube drainage within the first 24 hours postoperatively.
 The one-month and total hospital mortality rates were 6 percent and 12.5 percent, respectively.
 It is concluded that newer techniques to obtain optimal posterior mediastinal hemostasis have significantly reduced blood loss following heart-lung transplantation in our experience and have contributed to our excellent early postoperative results.

"Intraoperative peripheral Nd:YAG laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty: short-term and intermediate-term follow-up.
 Laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty was performed in 48 arteries (iliac, superficial femoral, and popliteal).
 Indications for surgery were limb salvage (25%), rest pain (38%), and claudication (38%).
 Patients were categorized into three groups: lesions less than 5 cm, greater than 5 to 10 cm, or greater than 10 cm in length.
 Demographic characteristics, risk factors, and outcome measures were compared by use of Fisher's exact test and Student's t test.
 The time for vascular patency failure was compared by use of a standard Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the three groups.
 Initial failure to recanalize was noted in 14% in lesions less than 5 cm, 40% in lesions greater than 5 to 10 cm, and 73% in lesions greater than 10 cm.
 The overall success rate was 38%, with a mean follow up of 1 year.
 The less than 5 cm lesion group had a significantly higher rate of overall success (59%, p = 0.005) than the other two groups combined.
 The greater than 10 cm lesion group did significantly worse (9%) than the other two groups combined (p = 0.028).
 Patients in the less than 5 cm group had significantly longer patency than the other two groups (p less than 0.01).
 Iliac lesions had a higher overall success rate (73%) than superficial femoral and popliteal artery lesions (35%) (p = 0.038).
 In conclusion, the widespread application of laser-assisted thermal balloon angioplasty cannot be justified without further long-term clinical and laboratory investigation.
 Conversely, the potential of this technique should not be dismissed out of hand.
 Proper patient selection, length and nature of the lesion to be treated, and the appropriate forms, doses, and method of delivery of laser energy, remain to be defined.

"Depression and recovery of right ventricular function after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Transient left ventricular dysfunction is commonly described in association with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
 We evaluated changes in right ventricular (RV) function after elective cardiac surgery in 24 patients with normal preoperative cardiac function.
 In all, irrespective of distribution of coronary artery disease or use of pharmacologic support, a transient depression of RV systolic function with respect to both preinduction and initial postoperative (Postop) values occurred 262 +/- 116 min post-CPB as represented by a decrease in RV stroke volume index (25.0 +/- 1.7 vs.

 This depression responded readily to pharmacologic therapy within 2 h, resolved within 24 h, and had no adverse consequences in these otherwise healthy patients.
 Further studies are needed to identify the cause of this phenomenon and its importance in patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction.

"Comparison of DNA content in gastric cancer cells between primary lesions and lymph node metastases.
 Cytophotomtric DNA contents of tumor cells in primary lesions and the corresponding metastatic lymph nodes were compared in 61 cases of gastric cancer to determine whether the DNA content remains stable during lymph node metastasis.
 The DNA distribution patterns were grouped into three types, according to the proportion of aneuploid cell population.
 Changes in DNA patterns between primary and metastatic lesions were evident in 36 of 61 patients (59.0%); in the remaining 25 (41.0%), the same DNA distribution patterns were noted for both lesions.
 In 33 of these 36, DNA pattern in the primary carcinoma was transformed into a more narrowly scattered one in the metastatic lesion of the lymph node.
 Mean and modal values and the frequency of cells over tetraploid (4c) or hexaploid (6c) were significantly higher in the primary lesion compared with findings in the metastatic lesions.
 This reduction in DNA content in the metastatic lesions was a more frequent occurrence in differentiated (18 of 23) than in undifferentiated adenocarcinoma (15 of 35) (P less than 0.01).
 Therefore, in primary lesions with a widely scattered DNA ploidy, the tumor cells with a smaller DNA ploidy frequently metastasized to lymph nodes, particularly in cases of a differentiated carcinoma.
 Such observations may be pertinent in future designing of treatment protocols.

"Nonosmotic stimuli alter osmoregulation in patients with spinal cord injury.
 Studies on two quadriplegic patients who developed severe hyponatremia during episodes of acute respiratory distress were performed to determine whether differences in osmoregulation of vasopressin release could be identified in these patients compared to other quadriplegic subjects previously studied in a similar manner.
 Both patients were clinically stable and normonatremic, with no signs or symptoms of respiratory distress, when the studies were performed.
 However, both exhibited evidence of hemodynamic instability in the sitting posture.
 Linear regression analysis of the plasma vasopressin/plasma osmolality (Pavp:Posm) relationship during infusions of 0.85 M sodium chloride showed no significant differences in either the slope (sensitivity) or abscissal intercept (osmotic threshold) of this relationship compared to that of other quadriplegic subjects when the patients were supine.
 In contrast, when the patients were studied in the sitting posture there was a marked shift in the relationship of Pavp:Posm indicative of increased sensitivity and reduced osmotic threshold for vasopressin release.
 The slopes of the Pavp:Posm relationships were 0.249 and 0.178 for the two patients, respectively, compared to 0.092 +/- 0.03 ( +/- SD) for previously studied quadriplegic subjects.
 Oral water-loading studies performed on one patient revealed marked impairment of urine-diluting ability and free water clearance in the sitting posture compared with observations in similar studies performed when the patient was supine.
 Impairment of renal water excretion could not be attributed to an effect of vasopressin, which was reduced to unquantifiable levels by water loading.
 These studies have shown that hemodynamic stress related to autonomic dysfunction in quadriplegic patients may result in marked alteration of osmoregulation of vasopressin release in more severely affected individuals.
 Such altered osmoregulation, which may also be associated with vasopressin-independent impairment of renal water excretion in the sitting posture, may be a predisposing factor in the development of hyponatremia, especially in the presence of other potent nonosmotic stimuli.

"Impaired iron uptake and transferrin binding by erythroblasts in the anaemia of rheumatoid arthritis.
 Serum and bone marrow from 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and five healthy controls were studied in order to establish a possible role of impaired iron uptake and transferrin binding by erythroblasts in the pathophysiology of anaemia of chronic disease (ACD) in RA.
 Iron incorporation into erythroblasts was reduced in patients with ACD using a method based on incubation of erythroblasts with radiolabelled 59Fe-125I-transferrin.
 It correlated negatively with C-reactive protein (CRP).
 In iron deficient RA patients it tended to be reduced as well.
 These patients had the same level of RA disease activity as in ACD.
 Transferrin binding by erythroblasts was significantly impaired in ACD compared to controls, although it tended to be reduced in all RA groups.
 These findings suggest that impaired iron uptake by erythroblasts, probably due to decreased transferrin binding to erythroblasts, might be a pathophysiological factor in ACD in RA.

"Prenatal screening: when and for whom?
 This report discusses the role of prenatal screening in preventing congenital abnormalities or, when prevention is not possible, in avoiding the conception or the birth of those who would have untreatable abnormalities.
 Women who are found by screening not to be immune to rubella can be safely vaccinated prior to pregnancy; those found to be at risk of having children with genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs disease or thalassemia have the option of avoiding the conception of affected offspring.
 Screening during pregnancy permits the primary prevention of Rh disease and its sequelae when it results in the prophylactic administration of Rh-immune globulin to unsensitized Rh-negative women.
 Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening identifies pregnant women who are at increased risk of carrying fetuses with neural tube defects or Down's syndrome, giving them the option of avoiding the birth of affected fetuses through abortion.
 Recombinant DNA technology will permit screening for many more genetic disorders as the disease-related genes and mutations are identified.
 For many of these disorders, the ability to predict the risk of disease will antedate preventive and therapeutic interventions by many years.
 During this lag phase, issues concerning the validity of the tests, the severity of the conditions for which screening is offered, the safety of the interventions, and the autonomy of the pregnant women in deciding to be screened are important.

 Characteristic findings in blink reflex are reported in a 55-year-old female with periodic ataxia.
 The blink reflexes on the side ipsilateral to the stimulation consisted of four components with latencies of 11, 21, 35 and 47 ms, instead of the usual two components seen in normal subjects.
 On the contralateral side, the last three components were also present.
 The second component was different from the normal R2 response in that its latency was shorter than normal and it did not habituate by stimulation at a rate of 10 Hz.
 In addition, it was more affected by diazepam than the third or fourth components.
 It is considered that R2 may have consisted of three components and that a shorter latency of the second component could be explained by facilitation.

"Diagnostic value of brush cytology in the diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma: a study in 65 patients with bile duct strictures.
 Malignant strictures of the extrahepatic bile ducts are difficult to distinguish from benign strictures, particularly in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis.
 Because attempts at diagnosing small cancers with fine-needle aspiration biopsy are not possible in the absence of an associated mass lesion and because the sensitivity of exfoliative biliary cytology is controversial, brush cytology has been used as a potential means of establishing a specific diagnosis of bile duct carcinoma.
 Herein we report our experience with this technique when performed on 65 patients over a 5-yr period.
 Each had at least one brushing.
 Thirty-seven were found to have bile duct carcinoma and 28 were found to have benign strictures.
 Of these 37, the first brushing was positive for malignancy in 15 (40%), whereas four (11%) had cells suspected but not diagnostic of malignancy.
 Thirteen patients with bile duct carcinoma whose initial brushings were negative for malignancy had second brushings.
 Of these, five (38%) had malignant cells, whereas three (24%) yielded suspicious cells.
 Three of the eight whose first two brushings were negative for malignancy were found to have malignant cells on the third brushing.
 In contrast, of the 28 patients with benign strictures, malignant cells were never found.
 However, in two patients, suspicious cells were reported with the first but not the second brushing.

"Diet, smoking, and alcohol: influence on coronary heart disease risk.
 The Framingham study on coronary heart disease (CHD) has shown that life-style, particularly diet, smoking, and alcohol consumption, has a great impact on the incidence of CHD.
 Blood lipoproteins, rather than total blood cholesterol, have been found to be more accurate predictors of CHD risk.
 Blood triglyceride, previously considered to have little bearing on CHD risk, was found to have a negative impact in many cases.
 A population subgroup with high triglyceride greater than or equal to 1.7 mmol/L (greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL), low high-density lipoprotein less than or equal to 1.04 mmol/L (less than or equal to 40 mg/dL), increased insulin resistance, and a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus has been found to be at increased risk for CHD.
 Diet intervention trials have shown that a reduction in total cholesterol and saturated fat consumption produced reduction in CHD incidence proportionate to the fall in cholesterol.
 Cigarette smoking increased CHD risk moderately; those who smoked one pack per day had twice the risk of nonsmokers.
 Alcohol consumption actually lowered CHD incidence in the Framingham study; however, when alcohol consumption was greater than two drinks per day, a rise in mortality from cancer and stroke was observed.

"Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) of the shoulder: a cause of shoulder pain?
 Shoulder pain is a common complaint and shoulder hyperostosis a frequent radiological condition.
 However, little is known about the association between the clinical and radiological findings.
 To evaluate the clinical relevance of shoulder hyperostosis we performed a controlled, blind study of 99 hospitalized probands with and without thoracospinal hyperostosis on lateral chest X-rays.
 The study included grading of the shoulder hyperostosis on the basis of three bilateral standard radiographs, assessing shoulder pain in a standardized way by an interviewer and recording extraskeletal causes of shoulder pain.
 The prevalence of shoulder hyperostosis was doubled in probands with thoracospinal hyperostosis compared to controls (chi 2 = 5.90, P less than 0.025, n = 99).
 Shoulder hyperostosis, irrespective of thoracospinal hyperostosis, predisposed to shoulder pain (40% versus 18%, chi 2 = 4.06, P less than 0.05, n = 74).

 TBS and seminiferous tubule diameter (STD) were found to decrease significantly after two hours of vascular occlusion and were similar regardless of whether the obstruction was produced by occlusion of arterial inflow or venous drainage, or both.
 Testicular concentration of enzymes decreased significantly after permanent ligation of the spermatic artery and vein, but decreased minimally when the vascular obstruction lasted less than 120 minutes.
 Testicular injury produced by venous occlusion was equally severe and occurred as rapidly as injury produced by arterial or combined arteriovenous occlusion.

 Unobstructed arterial flow to the distal half of the thigh was present in 26% of patients, and 16% had unobstructed flow to the upper third of the leg with occlusions of all three leg arteries distal to this point and reconstitution of some patent named artery in the lower leg or foot.
 In the last 2 years, 99% of all patients with a threatened limb and without severe organic mental syndrome or midfoot gangrene were amenable to revascularization by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), arterial bypass, or a combination of the two, although some distal arteries used for bypass insertion were heavily diseased or isolated segments without an intact plantar arch.
 Limb salvage was achieved and maintained in more than 90% of recent patient cohorts, with a mean procedural mortality rate of 3.3%.
 Recent strategies that contributed to these results include (1) distal origin short vein grafts from the below-knee popliteal or tibial arteries to an ankle or foot artery (291 cases); (2) combined PTA and bypass (245 cases); (3) more distal PTA of popliteal and tibial artery stenoses (233 cases); (4) use of in situ or ectopic reversed autogenous vein for infrapopliteal bypasses, even when vein diameter was 3 to 4 mm; (5) composite-sequential femoropopliteal-distal (PTFE/vein) bypasses; (6) reintervention when a procedure thrombosed (637 cases) or was threatened by a hemodynamically significant inflow, outflow, or graft lesion (failing graft, 252 cases); (7) frequent follow-up to detect threatening lesions before graft thrombosis occurred and to permit correction of lesions by PTA (58%) or simple reoperation; and (8) unusual approaches to all infrainguinal arteries to facilitate secondary operations, despite scarring and infection.
 Primary major amputation rates decreased from 41% to 5% and total amputation rates decreased from 49% to 14%.
 Aggressive policies to save threatened limbs thus are supported.

"Detection of a human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle antigenically related to HIV.
 Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by dryness of the mouth and eyes.
 The loss of salivary and lacrimal gland function is accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration.
 Because similar symptoms and glandular pathology are observed in certain persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a search was initiated for a possible retroviral etiology in this syndrome.
 A human intracisternal A-type retroviral particle that is antigenically related to HIV was detected in lymphoblastoid cells exposed to homogenates of salivary tissue from patients with Sjogren's syndrome.
 Comparison of this retroviral particle to HIV indicates that they are distinguishable by several ultrastructural, physical, and enzymatic criteria.

"Seizures in the alcoholic patient.
 The First International Symposium on Alcohol and Seizures (September 1988, Washington, DC) convened experts from North America and Europe to discuss the basic and clinical research findings in this field.
 Most of the observations communicated at this symposium are included in this article.
 Emergency physicians are familiar with the alcoholic patient who presents during or after a seizure(s).
 This familiarity must not obscure the fact that a significant minority of these patients will have an underlying process that can cause morbidity or mortality if the unsuspecting physician does not have an organized and methodic approach to the evaluation and management of the seizing alcoholic patient.
 Status epilepticus should be evaluated and treated in a similar fashion, whether or not the patient is an alcoholic.
 Otherwise, almost without exception, there are nuances and controversies with respect to the evaluation and management of the alcoholic patient with a seizure(s), from the indications for CT scan, to the proper role of sedatives and anticonvulsants, and the need for admission.
 The emergency physician must remain a patient advocate.
 The great majority of alcoholic patients with seizures who require admission can be treated satisfactorily at the hospital of presentation.

"The Hymenoptera venom study. III: Safety of venom immunotherapy.
 One thousand four hundred ten (44%) of the 3236 subjects in the Hymenoptera venom study accepted venom immunotherapy (VIT).
 Time to maintenance averaged 95 days, and the largest number achieved maintenance (147 subjects, 10.4%) at day 56.
 Ninety-two percent of the treated subjects achieved maintenance, and 84% continued therapy, most subjects (91%) until the study was terminated.
 One hundred seventy-one subjects (12%) experienced 327 treatment systemic reactions (Srs).
 The incidence of pruritus and angioedema/urticaria was similar with mild, moderate, or severe SRs.
 The SR severity did not correlate with the severity of the most recent sting before entry into the Hymenoptera-venom study, the most severe historical sting SR, the most severe SR during venom skin tests, the total dose of venom, the degree of skin test reactivity, or the lowest concentration yielding a positive skin test.
 Most SRs occurred between 1 and 50 micrograms and at maintenance; honeybee or wasp venoms were most likely to produce SR.
 This study, the largest of its kind with the use of standardized extracts, demonstrates (1) that there was good compliance, (2) that various historical and diagnostic criteria did not predict SRs to VIT, (3) that SRs to VIT were most likely to occur between 1 and 50 micrograms and at maintenance, (4) that honeybee or wasp venoms were most likely to produce an SR, and (5) that VIT is relatively safe.

"Calcium channel blockers versus angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors: renal effects.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are two classes of antihypertensive agents with novel effects on renal function.
 In both experimental and clinical studies, calcium channel blockers tend to increase renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary sodium excretion in essential hypertension.
 ACE inhibitors have similar effects on renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in essential hypertension, but they tend to cause sodium retention.
 ACE inhibitors can cause marked reductions in glomerular filtration rate in renovascular hypertension, making them a problematic choice for the treatment of this form of hypertension.
 In chronic, progressive renal diseases, ACE inhibitors have been shown to decrease protein excretion and morphologic evidence of glomerulosclerosis.
 The relationship of the decrease in protein excretion to the progression of renal disease has not yet been established.

"Comparison of endometrial biopsy and urinary pregnanediol glucuronide concentration in the diagnosis of luteal phase defect.
 To determine if pregnanediol glucuronide (PG) excretion is useful in luteal phase assessment, we compared daily first morning urinary PG concentrations during the luteal phase in nine normal and nine deficient cycles.
 Total luteal pregnanediol excretion (44.1 +/- 11.3 versus 64.0 +/- 11.6 area units +/- SEM) was not different.
 However, significantly less pregnanediol was excreted by the abnormal group during the 1st 5 days of the luteal phase (12.7 +/- 1.2 versus 18.0 +/- 1.7 area units +/- SEM, respectively).
 Thus, delayed PG excretion may be characteristic of luteal phase defect and measurement of urinary PG may be useful only if daily samples during the early luteal phase are obtained.

"Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty in the treatment of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Stimulated skeletal muscle grafts have been proposed as a means to reinforce ventricular wall in the treatment of severe myocardial failure.
 Latissimus dorsi cardiomyoplasty was performed in 11 patients with advanced heart failure due to cardiomyopathy who were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV despite maximal medical therapy.
 There were no operative deaths.
 Eight patients were followed for a mean of 10.8 months.
 Two patients remain in muscle conditioning protocol.
 One patient died with latissimus dorsi ischemia and congestive heart failure.
 Four of the eight patients in long-term follow-up are in NYHA class I, three in class II, and one in class III.
 At 3 months of follow-up, rest radioisotopic left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 20.5 +/- 3.6% to 26.8 +/- 8.1% (p less than 0.01).
 Doppler-echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular segmental wall shortening improved from 11.3 +/- 2.5% to 16.5 +/- 3.9% (p less than 0.01) and left ventricular stroke volume from 22.9 +/- 4.6 to 33.1 +/- 10 ml (p less than 0.01).
 Cardiopulmonary exercise test showed that maximal oxygen consumption during treadmill test increased from 14.8 +/- 3.7 to 18.2 +/- 3.3 ml/kg.min (p less than 0.05).
 At 6 months of follow-up, all the above values remained essentially unchanged.
 Furthermore, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia was abolished without specific medical therapy in four patients.
 Thus, cardiomyoplasty improves left ventricular function, reverses congestive heart failure, and may improve long-term survival in severe cardiomyopathies.

"Time to recurrence varies inversely with thickness in clinical stage 1 cutaneous melanoma.
 The thickness of a tumor has been identified as the principal prognostic factor in cutaneous malignant melanoma.
 However, time to recurrence has not conclusively been related to thickness.
 A retrospective study of 216 patients with a primary cutaneous malignant melanoma that recurred was conducted to clarify this relationship and investigate possible independent relationships between age at diagnosis and sex of patients to time to recurrence.
 The results of analysis of linear regression revealed an inverse linear relationship between thickness and time to recurrence (p less than 0.001).
 Patients more than 50 years of age at the time of diagnosis were shown to relapse sooner than those less than 50 years of age (p = 0.014).
 Sex was not a significant factor in predicting time to recurrence (p greater than 0.10).
 These results suggest that thickness of tumor provides an indication of time to recurrence in those patients destined to recur and stress the need for long term surveillance in patients with a history of malignant melanoma because of the possibility of late relapse even with thin lesions.

"Clinical and pathological findings in prostates following intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations.
 The prostates of 36 patients who were treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin were evaluated by digital rectal examination and transrectal ultrasonography.
 When abnormal palpatory and/or ultrasonographic findings were detected, core needle biopsies from the suspicious areas were performed.
 Of the 36 patients 20 underwent biopsies of the prostate.
 Pathological findings revealed typical granulomas in 8 patients (3 caseating and 5 noncaseating multifocal granulomas).
 Nonspecific chronic prostatitis was noted in 4 patients and benign prostatic hyperplasia was noted in 8.
 The number of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations ranged from 6 to 19.
 The interval from initiation of therapy to biopsy ranged from 1.5 to 14.5 months.
 Caseating granulomas were found during the early course of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations (1.5 to 3.0 months), whereas noncaseating granulomas were detected at later stages (4 to 14.5 months).
 These findings present a high incidence of granuloma formation in patients treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin.
 The duration of therapy is a determinant factor in the induction of granuloma type.

"Interferon alpha-2a and 5-fluorouracil for advanced colorectal carcinoma. Assessment of activity and toxicity.
 Preclinical data showed that the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are augmented by interferon (IFN).
 In a small study, 13 of 17 patients with advanced colorectal cancer responded to a regimen of 5-FU with IFN.
 Using the same dose and schedule as in this pilot study, 38 previously untreated patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma were treated with continuous intravenous (IV) infusion of 5-FU 750 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, followed by weekly bolus 5-FU at 750 mg/m2 and subcutaneous IFN at 9 million units three times per week.
 Of 35 evaluable patients, nine (26%) had a partial response (95% confidence limit, 11% to 41%), with a median response duration of 7.5 months (range, 4.4 to greater than 11.7 months).
 Seven patients (20%) had a minor response, and ten (28%) had stable disease.
 The most common toxicities observed were stomatitis (52%) and diarrhea (43%).
 Neurotoxicity was seen in 34% of patients and consisted of gait disturbance, dizziness, confusion, memory loss, and dementia.
 Because of toxicity, 84% of patients required a reduction of the IFN dose by at least 50%, and 63% required reduction of the 5-FU dose by at least 25%.
 Although the combination of 5-FU and IFN in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma has some activity, the regimen was toxic, and the observed response rate (26%) was not substantially superior to alternative 5-FU programs.

"Relation between beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure. The Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Research Group.
 This study examined the relations among beta-adrenergic blocker use, various correlates of left ventricular function and the chance of developing congestive heart failure in patients after myocardial infarction.
 The study was performed with the placebo group of the Multicenter Diltiazem Post-Infarction Trial.
 Ejection fraction data were available in 1,084 patients; of these, 557 were receiving a beta-blocker and 527 were not.
 In addition to ejection fraction, other correlates of left ventricular function included the presence or absence of pulmonary rales, chest X-ray film evidence of pulmonary congestion and the presence of an S3 gallop.
 Beta-blocker use was less frequent in patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, rales, an S3 gallop and pulmonary congestion on chest X-ray film.
 Twenty-one percent of patients with an ejection fraction less than 30%, 42% of patients with rales, 28% of patients with an S3 gallop and 28% of patients with pulmonary congestion were receiving beta-blocker therapy.
 For every correlate of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure was greater in patients with diminished left ventricular function than in those without.
 For each level of left ventricular function, the chance of developing congestive heart failure requiring treatment was greater in patients not taking a beta-blocker.

"Complications of stapled anastomoses in anterior resection for rectal carcinoma: colorectal anastomosis versus coloanal anastomosis.
 Postoperative results of 48 patients who underwent anterior resection using the EEA-stapler were evaluated.
 In all but 2 cases the indication for surgery was colorectal carcinoma.
 In 24 patients an anastomosis was created above the 5 cm level (above the anal verge: colorectal anastomosis) and in 24 at the 0-5 cm level (coloanal anastomosis).
 There was no perioperative mortality.
 The only complication observed in the colorectal anastomosis group was one case of late anastomotic stenosis.
 In the coloanal anastomosis group there were 4 cases with early anastomosis leaks, 3 cases with late stenosis and 5 cases with various degrees of late fecal incontinence, ultimately resulting in a permanent diverting stoma in 5 (10.4%) patients.
 We conclude that for rectal tumors the EEA-stapled anterior resection provides excellent functional results in most cases.
 Stapled coloanal anastomoses more often demonstrate various (early and late) complications.
 Nevertheless in spite of chronic discomfort, many patients still prefer their complaints to a permanent stoma.

"Cardiovascular effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide in acromegaly.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the cardiovascular effects of the somatostatin analog octreotide in patients with acromegaly.
 DESIGN: Prospective nonrandomized study.
 SETTING: Referral-based endocrinology clinic.
 PATIENTS: Seven patients with active acromegaly, three of whom had refractory congestive heart failure.
 The other four patients were free of symptoms associated with heart failure.
 INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with octreotide, 100 to 500 micrograms subcutaneously three times daily.
 The three patients with heart failure continued to receive cardiovascular therapy (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, digitalis, diuretics).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During octreotide therapy, patients showed a rapid decrease in growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1): Mean levels (+/- SD) fell from 28.1 +/- 32.7 micrograms/L to 5.2 +/- 8.3 micrograms/L and 740 +/- 126 micrograms/L to 372 +/- 64 micrograms/L, respectively (P less than 0.025).
 Plasma volume returned to normal and heart rate decreased significantly.
 In the four patients without heart failure, right-heart catheterization done before and after 3 months of octreotide therapy showed an 18.3% +/- 11% reduction in stroke volume and a return to normal of the cardiac index.
 The three patients with congestive heart failure, evaluated before and after 40 days and up to 2 years of therapy, showed a dramatic clinical improvement that was associated with an increase in stroke volume (by 24% to 51%).
 In these patients, the cardiac index remained in the normal range, filling pressures were markedly decreased, and pulmonary wedge pressure returned to normal.
 This improvement was sustained for up to 3 years in the two patients with heart failure who were receiving long-term treatment.
 CONCLUSION: The rapid and sustained cardiac improvement seen in our patients shows that octreotide therapy for patients with acromegaly may be highly beneficial, even in those patients with advanced cardiac failure.

"Income and survival in chronic dialysis patients.
 The relationship between income and survival rates for chronic dialysis patients in Michigan was examined.
 To evaluate the relative risk (RR) of dying, by income, a Cox survival regression model was used to adjust for age, race (black versus white), gender, dialytic treatment modality, year of first end-stage renal disease (ESRD) therapy, and primary cause of ESRD.
 The average household income reported from census data for the ZIP Code of residence for each patient was analyzed as a socioeconomic indicator.
 Treatment modality on day 120 of ESRD was classified as either center hemodialysis (HD) or CAPD.
 All new patients, aged 20-59 and registered at the Michigan Kidney Registry between 1/1/80 and 12/31/87 were included in the study.
 Patients were followed from day 180 of ESRD until death, censoring at transplant, or 12/31/87.
 The adjusted relative risk of dying decreased for black patients by 3.3% per $1,000 increase in income (p less than 0.01), while the trend by income for white patients was negligible (p greater than 0.10).
 The difference in trends for the two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.01).
 This is a surprising result, since white patients have higher death rates, overall, than do black patients, particularly among subgroups with diabetes and hypertension whose RR was 1.77 and 1.82, respectively.
 Poor socioeconomic status of the area of residence has a strongly negative effect on survival for black patients, but not for white patients.
 The reasons for the relationship of death rates with income, especially for black patients, need to be examined in greater detail.

"Glucagon, catecholamine and pancreatic polypeptide secretion in type I diabetic recipients of pancreas allografts.
 Successful pancreas transplantation in type I diabetic patients restores normal fasting glucose levels and biphasic insulin responses to glucose.
 However, virtually no data from pancreas recipients are available relative to other islet hormonal responses or hormonal counterregulation of hypoglycemia.
 Consequently, glucose, glucagon, catecholamine, and pancreatic polypeptide responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to stimulation with arginine and secretin were examined in 38 diabetic pancreas recipients, 54 type I diabetic nonrecipients, and 26 nondiabetic normal control subjects.
 Glucose recovery after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in pancreas recipients was significantly improved.
 Basal glucagon levels were significantly higher in recipients compared with nonrecipients and normal subjects.
 Glucagon responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia were significantly greater in the pancreas recipients compared with nonrecipients and similar to that observed in control subjects.
 Glucagon responses to intravenous arginine were significantly greater in pancreas recipients than that observed in both the nonrecipients and normal subjects.
 No differences were observed in epinephrine responses during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
 No differences in pancreatic polypeptide responses to hypoglycemia were observed when comparing the recipient and nonrecipient groups, both of which were less than that observed in the control subjects.
 Our data demonstrate significant improvement in glucose recovery after hypoglycemia which was associated with improved glucagon secretion in type I diabetic recipients of pancreas transplantation.

 Doppler flow velocity waveform analysis (FVWFA), recorded from the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) and the radial artery (RA), was performed on 36 women in attempting to detect an initial diabetic microangiopathy (DM).
 The study comprised two groups of women affected by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, 6 patients (pts) of reproductive age (1), 12 pts in menopause (II), and two groups of age-matched healthy controls (C) (III and IV).
 Clinical signs of initial DM were present in group I.
 All the examined pts were nonsmokers and normotensive and without cardiopathy, signs of diabetic macroangiopathy, collagen vascular disease and/or Raynaud's phenomenon, and renal failure.
 Four waveform dimensions capable of separating different degrees of peripheral obstructive arteriolar disease were determined on velocity tracing and the results used in a single best discriminant equation.
 The resultant discriminant score (DS), derived by FVWFA on DPA, showed a highly accurate rate of separating the young pts with DM from both C and the pts in menopause without DM.
 Furthermore, the resultant DS was statistically not different in groups II, III, and IV.
 In conclusion, FVWFA on DPA, in this experience, has proved to be an accurate and sensitive method in the detection of initial DM.

"Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm masquerading as occlusion of the inferior vena cava.
 Inflammatory aneurysms are an uncommon disorder that represent between 5% and 10% of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
 Their presentation is often variable and may include pain and obstruction of adjacent anatomic structures.
 This report describes a 68-year-old man who sought treatment after insidious onset of progressive bilateral lower extremity edema over a 6-month period.
 Noninvasive studies were suggestive of bilateral iliac vein occlusion, and a venogram showed a nearly obstructed vena cava from external compression.
 A CT scan showed a thick-walled infrarenal abdominal aneurysm.
 At exploration an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm was found.
 Because of the presence of dense inflammatory changes surrounding the aneurysm and extending into the pelvis, the surgical procedure of choice was an aortobifemoral bypass graft done with Dacron.
 The aneurysmal wall was debrided from the vena cava.
 His postoperative course was uneventful, his edema resolved, and follow-up noninvasive studies were normal.

"Silk-induced asthma in children: a report of 64 cases.
 A total of 64 children less than 15 years of age with asthma caused by silk were studied.
 The diagnosis was based on a history of wheezing, positive skin tests to silk, positive conjunctival or nasal provocation tests, or serum IgE-Sw (silk waste).
 The average age of onset was 4 years 2 months.
 Sex ratio (M:F) was 3.6:1.
 A positive skin test is essential for the diagnosis.
 Conjunctival provocation tests were performed in 80% of cases because of reliability, safety, and convenience.
 The first symptom appeared an average of 10 months after initial exposure to silk.
 In 61% of patients, asthma was accompanied by allergic rhinitis but in only 14% of cases by conjunctivitis.
 In most cases, asthma occurred in winter, due to seasonal use of bed quilts or clothes filled with silk.
 Silk is a highly potent allergen.
 The average mean wheal diameter elicited by silk in prick testing was larger than two histamine equivalent prick tests.
 A cross reactivity exists among mulberry silk, and silkworm cocoons, batryticated silkworms, and silkworm chrysalis.

"Long-term evaluation of hemiparkinsonian monkeys after adrenal autografting or cavitation alone.
 Autografts of adrenal medulla were implanted into preformed cavities in the caudate nuclei of four rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).
 Five other hemiparkinsonian monkeys underwent caudate cavitation, but received no tissue implant.
 All of the animals had marked bradykinesia of the affected arm and stable apomorphine-induced turning before cavitation or implantation.
 Moderate behavioral recovery was seen in all five monkeys with cavitation and two of the three monkey with long-term adrenal autografts (the fourth adrenal recipient was sacrificed 10 days after grafting).
 The improvement occurred months after the procedure and was not as early or as complete as that seen after fetal dopaminergic grafts.
 Surviving adrenal tissue was found only in the animal that showed no behavioral recovery.
 The other two adrenal autograft recipients (with no surviving adrenal medulla) and all of the animals with cavitation had ingrowth of dopaminergic fibers from the area olfactoria and nucleus accumbens into the caudate, oriented toward the cavity.
 These findings show that the mechanism of improvement after adrenal medullary implants for parkinsonism is not dopamine secretion by chromaffin cells, but may be related to the sprouted host fibers.
 The results also indicate that the limited recovery after adrenal implants in parkinsonian patients may be a result of the cavitation, and not necessarily the result of tissue implantation.

"Iron: nutrition monitoring and nutrition status assessment.
 The majority of anemias in the United States are characterized by low mean corpuscular volume and thus are classified as microcytic.
 Iron deficiency, chronic disease and thalassemia traits are the three leading causes of microcytic anemia.
 The true cause of anemia must always be sought so that the prevalence estimates of iron deficiency are accurate and so that appropriate treatment can be initiated for the anemic individual.
 In both the clinical setting and in surveys, the most frequent differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia will involve distinguishing between iron deficiency and chronic disease.
 Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), zeta-sedimentation rate (ZSR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in a variety of diseases.
 These indicators may help differentiate the anemia of chronic disease from iron deficiency, so that iron deficiency is not overestimated in hospitalized and aged populations.
 The red cell distribution width (RDW) appears to be elevated to a greater extent in iron deficiency than in chronic disease or thalassemia traits.

"Healing of non-vascularised diaphyseal bone transplants. An experimental study.
 Four different experiments were performed to study the healing of a large, non-vascularised, diaphyseal, bone segment in adult cats.
 In the first experiment, a 4 cm segment of tibia with its periosteum was excised and replaced in its bed.
 The other experiments were similar, except that in the second, the periosteum of the segment was removed, in the third its medullary canal was blocked with a Silastic rod, and in the last group the segment was isolated from its muscle bed by a Silastic sheet.
 The reparative processes were quantified by estimating the resorption index, the cortical new bone formation index, the callus encasement index, and the osteocyte count.
 Bone resorption and apposition occurred in the segment even when the periosteum was absent or the medullary canal was blocked, with osseous union at both ends by eight to 12 weeks, provided the segment was not isolated from its muscle bed.
 Thus, the muscle bed played a significant role in these reparative processes.

"Intraoperative blood pressure. What patterns identify patients at risk for postoperative complications? 
 While monitoring blood pressure is a routine part of intraoperative management, several methods have been proposed to characterize intraoperative hemodynamic patterns as predictors of postoperative complications.
 In this prospective study of a high-risk population of hypertensive and diabetic patients undergoing elective noncardiac surgery, one objective was to compare different approaches to the assessment of intraoperative hemodynamic patterns to identify those patterns most likely to be associated with postoperative complications.
 Twenty-one per cent of the 254 patients sustained cardiac or renal complications after operation.
 Patients with more than 1 hour of greater than or equal to 20-mmHg decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or patients with less than 1 hour of greater than or equal to 20-mmHg decreases and more than 15 minutes of greater than or equal to 20-mmHg increases were at highest risk for postoperative complications.
 Together these two patterns had a 46% sensitivity rate and a 70% specificity rate in predicting postoperative complications.
 Using 20% change in intraoperative MAP produced results nearly identical to 20-mmHg changes.
 When the duration of 20-mmHg changes was accounted for, changes of a greater magnitude (e.g., 40 mmHg) were not significant independent predictors of complications.
 The use of the mean difference from preoperative MAP was misleading because patients who experienced both high and low MAPs tended to have nearly normal mean MAPs, but high complication rates.
 The absolute magnitude of intraoperative MAPs, regardless of the preoperative levels, also was evaluated.
 The overall mean intraoperative MAP was not a significant predictor of complications.
 Specific intraoperative MAPs (e.g., less than 70 mmHg and more than 120 mmHg) also were evaluated.
 While neither was a significant predictor, there was a trend for increased complications among patients whose MAPs decreased to less than 70 mmHg.
 Intraoperative blood pressure should be analyzed in relation to the patient's preoperative blood pressure.
 Prolonged changes of more than 20 mmHg or 20% in relation to preoperative levels were significantly related to complications.

"Immediate contact reactions to chemicals in the fragrance mix and a study of the quenching action of eugenol.
 In this study, the nature of non-immune immediate contact reactions (NIICR) produced by cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were investigated, with particular interest in the 'quenching' ability of eugenol.
 Three groups of human subjects were studied, and the guinea-pig ear was also used as a model of NIICR.
 Cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were all able to produce NIICR in the majority of subjects studied.
 There was a strong correlation between the susceptibility of each subject to each urticant, but no correlation between the susceptibility to NIICR and age, atopic status or tanning ability.
 Eugenol caused a reduction in NIICR induced by all three urticants.
 This 'quenching' effect was apparent even when the eugenol was applied up to 60 min prior to application of cinnamic aldehyde, and its effect was not eliminated by washing.
 In the guinea-pig-ear model, ear thickening was induced by all three urticants, and this response was inhibited by eugenol.

"Natural history of cardiac rhabdomyoma in infancy and childhood.
 Although spontaneous regression of cardiac rhabdomyoma has been reported, prognosis is still considered to be poor and surgery continues to be indicated.
 The experience with rhabdomyoma diagnosed in live infants over a 20-year period was reviewed.
 Diagnosis by angiography or echocardiography was accepted only if multiple tumors were present or if tuberous sclerosis was also diagnosed.
 Nine patients (3 diagnosed prenatally and the remaining 6 at age less than 8 months) were identified as having a total of 24 tumors.
 Measurements in 2 planes demonstrated at least some evidence of regression in 24 patients (100%), with 20 of 24 having complete resolution.
 One patient required delayed surgery for excision of a subaortic ridge that appeared at the site of a resolved tumor.
 Our findings suggest that pediatric cardiac rhabdomyoma is most often a benign condition in which spontaneous regression is the rule.
 Surgery is recommended only for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or severe hemodynamic compromise.

"Predicting risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia: selection criteria for clinical trials 
 Early identification of neonates in whom bronchopulmonary dysplasia is most likely to develop permits appropriate enrollment into clinical trials testing early intervention therapies for the prevention or treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Analysis of 160 neonatal intensive care unit survivors to 28 days revealed that supplemental oxygen requirement at 28 days could be predicted by a logistic regression including (1) birth weight, gestational age, 5-minute Apgar score, and peak inspiratory pressure at 12 hours for 12-hour-old neonates and (2) birth weight, gestational age, peak inspiratory pressure at 12 hours, and mean airway pressure at 10 days for 10-day-old neonates.
 These two regression analyses were applied prospectively to three new data sets totaling 238 neonates to test their predictive ability.
 Neonates were classified into low-, moderate-, or high-risk groups on the basis of their predicted probability of requiring oxygen supplementation at 28 days; low = probability of less than 25%, moderate = probability of 25% to 75%, and high = probability greater than 75%.
 Although these populations were demographically distinct from the original group, the regression analyses performed well.
 The regression analysis for 12 hours of age classified 125 neonates at low risk of whom 9% required supplemental oxygen at 28 days, and the regression analysis for 10 days classified 141 neonates at low risk of whom 7% required supplemental oxygen.
 The 12-hour regression analysis classified 80 neonates at moderate risk of whom 33% required supplemental oxygen at 28 days and the 10-day regression analysis classified 49 neonates at moderate risk of whom 24% required supplemental oxygen.

"Does isoflurane lead to a higher incidence of myocardial infarction and perioperative death than enflurane in coronary artery surgery? A clinical study of 1178 patients 
 To examine if the choice of volatile agents influences cardiac outcome in coronary artery surgery, 1178 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting without additional operations received enflurane (608) or isoflurane (570) as their primary anesthetics.
 The inspired concentration of volatile agent (administered with 50% nitrous oxide) was adjusted depending on the level of blood pressure at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.
 In addition to the volatile agent assigned, each patient received small doses of fentanyl at induction and before sternotomy (total 0.006-0.008 mg/kg).
 The groups did not differ in preoperative and surgical characteristics except for a more frequent history of renal dysfunction in patients given isoflurane.
 The rates of postoperative myocardial infarction, administration of positive inotropic agents at the time of weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, and in-hospital deaths in the enflurane and isoflurane groups were 1.8% and 4.0% (P less than 0.05), 4.9% and 8.1% (P less than 0.05%), and 0.3% and 2.1% (P less than 0.01), respectively.
 Although the mechanism of the adverse effects of isoflurane could not be clarified in this study, these results demonstrate that the use of isoflurane could be inappropriate in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

"Perinatal infection of human T-lymphotropic virus type I, the etiologic virus of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. DNA amplification of specific human T-lymphotropic virus type I sequences.
 A gene amplification technique, polymerase chain reaction, was used to detect human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, in mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and breast milk of ten HTLV-I carrier gravida.
 The DNA in umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells of the neonates born to the HTLV-I carrier gravida were also amplified and examined for the possibility of HTLV-I infection via placenta during pregnancy.
 The HTLV-I sequences were detected both in the peripheral blood and milk of all ten carrier gravida by Southern blot analysis of amplified DNA.
 However, HTLV-I proviral DNA could not be detected in the cord blood of the carriers' neonates, indicating that transplacental infection of HTLV-I should be rare and that postpartum infection via breast milk is a likely major perinatal transmission route.

"Modulatory action of adenosine on gastric function and ethanol-induced mucosal damage in rats.
 This study examines the gastric effects of adenosine and its antagonist, theophylline, on secretory function, mucosal blood flow, and on ethanol-induced glandular mucosal damage in rats that were fasted for 24 hr before experimentation.
 The animals were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and their tracheae cannulated.
 An ex vivo stomach chamber then was prepared.
 The luminal bathing solution was collected every 15 min and the concentrations of H+ and Na+ were determined by a pH autotitrator and an ionmeter, respectively.
 The glandular mucosal blood flow was measured by a laser Doppler flowmeter and the severity of lesions was determined by measuring the hemorrhagic areas.
 Adenosine administration (2.5 or 7.5 mg/kg, subcutaneous) markedly lowered the H+ and Na+ output but increased the secretory volume and mucosal blood flow in a dose-dependent manner.
 The same doses of the nucleoside also prevented ethanol-induced mucosal damage.
 These effects were prevented by pretreatment with theophylline (30 or 60 mg/kg, subcutaneous).
 Ethanol given alone significantly depressed the H+ and Na+ secretion.
 Both effects were not modified by adenosine treatment.
 However, the depressive action of ethanol on mucosal blood flow was prevented by adenosine.
 These findings indicate that adenosine modulates the physiological function of the stomach.
 It also directly activates the defensive mechanism of the stomach, which is partially mediated by the improvement of the gastric mucosal blood flow and an increase in the nonacid component of gastric secretion.

"Options for surgical repair in hearts with univentricular atrioventricular connection and subaortic stenosis.
 Thirteen patients have undergone surgical treatment because of subaortic obstruction in hearts with a univentricular atrioventricular connection.
 Nine patients underwent surgical enlargement of the ventricular septal defect and four patients had construction of an aortopulmonary anastomosis and closure of the pulmonary trunk (the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure).
 Two patients undergoing enlargement of the septal defect and two having the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure also had a modified Fontan procedure.
 One patient had complete atrioventricular dissociation after direct enlargement of the ventricular septal defect, which necessitated insertion of an epicardial pacemaker.
 One patient died within 30 days of the operation after enlargement of the defect and two patients after the Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure.
 There was one late death, occurring in a patient who underwent enlargement of the ventricular septal defect.
 Ten patients have subsequently undergone conventional cardiac catheterization and angiography or transcutaneous Doppler flow studies to assess the relief of the subaortic obstruction.
 The result has been satisfactory in all.
 Because of this experience, we now recommend direct surgical enlargement of the restrictive ventricular septal defect for direct relief of subaortic stenosis occurring with a univentricular atrioventricular connection to a dominant left ventricle, inasmuch as it appears to be hemodynamically effective with a low operative mortality and morbidity.
 The Damus-Kaye-Stansel procedure can also have a role in relieving subaortic stenosis when the atria are connected to a dominant right ventricle.

"Calcium and calcium binding in human gallstone disease.
 Precipitation of calcium salts from bile is important in pigment gallstone formation and may serve as a nidus for cholesterol precipitation.
 We compared gallbladder bile from patients with symptomatic gallstone disease (40 with cholesterol gallstones and 12 with pigment gallstones) with bile from 10 patients undergoing surgery for non-biliary tract disease.
 Bile from patients with gallstone disease was less concentrated, with decreased sodium, bile salt, and phospholipid concentrations, but elevated biliary calcium concentrations were not observed.
 The relationship between free ionized calcium and total calcium was similar in all groups, indicating no difference in calcium binding by gallstone-containing bile.
 We cannot exclude elevated biliary calcium level as a factor in gallstone pathogenesis, as it could be a transient event.
 The importance of calcium precipitation was supported by our finding that more than half of the samples were saturated or supersaturated with at least one calcium salt, calcium carbonate.

"Long-term 6-mercaptopurine treatment in adolescents with Crohn's disease 
 Although 6-mercaptopurine is often used to treat adolescents with intractable Crohn's disease, its long-term efficacy has not yet been studied in this population.
 This study shows data derived from 36 adolescents (mean age +/- SD, 16.5 +/- 3.3 years; 27 males, 9 females) treated at least 6 months with 6-mercaptopurine (1.5 mg.kg-1.day-1, maximum of 75 mg/day).
 Sites of Crohn's disease at the start of 6-mercaptopurine therapy included 17 ileocolic, 9 pancolic, 7 small bowel, and 3 partial colon.
 All had received corticosteroids, sulfasalazine, antibiotics, and nutritional support for 5.0 +/- 3.0 years before administering 6-mercaptopurine, but intractable symptoms persisted.
 Disease activity lessened during the first year of 6-mercaptopurine, reflected by a higher Lloyd-Still disease activity score (pre, 64 +/- 9 vs.
 6-mercaptopurine, 72 +/- 11; P less than 0.0001).
 General activity, physical examination, nutrition, and laboratory subscores all improved (P less than 0.004).
 Lessened disease activity occurred despite concomitant decrease in duration of prednisone use (pre, 9.5 +/- 4.2 vs.
 6-mercaptopurine, 6.6 +/- 4.9 months/year; P less than 0.001) and cumulative annual prednisone exposure (pre, 3672 +/- 2106 vs.
 6-mercaptopurine, 1964 +/- 1460 mg; P less than 0.0007).
 The frequency of perianal fistulae and abscesses also decreased (P less than 0.01) during treatment.
 Annual rates of hospitalization decreased in 44% of subjects during 6-mercaptopurine treatment, while increasing in only 22%.
 Follow-up beyond 1 year of 6-mercaptopurine treatment showed continued remission in 23 of 30 subjects.
 No serious complications were seen.
 6-mercaptopurine is an effective long-term therapy for adolescents with intractable Crohn's disease.
 While inducing remission, it also has a significant steroid-sparing effect which may be of particular benefit to this population.

"Positive and negative regulation of proliferation and differentiation in tracheobronchial epithelial cells.
 The lung (in particular the bronchial epithelium) is a major site for tumor formation in humans.
 Environmental factors in conjunction with genetic factors are important determinants in this disease.
 The acquisition of defects in the control of proliferation and differentiation appears to constitute crucial steps in the transition of a normal to a neoplastic cell.
 Several factors have been identified that control positively or negatively the proliferation and differentiation of tracheobronchial epithelial cells.
 These factors include EGF/TGF alpha, TGF beta, insulin/IGFI, KGF, certain cytokines, retinoids, and activators of protein kinase C.
 Studies with neoplastic cells have identified several protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes whose gene products are involved in the regulation of cell growth of normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells, and when mutated, lost, or activated, bring about a neoplastic phenotype.
 Future studies on the precise function of these genes will help to elucidate the mechanisms by which proliferation and differentiation in normal tracheobronchial epithelial cells are regulated and help to understand the molecular changes involved in diseases such as cancer.

 The prognosis was dismal.
 Most of the patients, including three radically operated cases of early gastric cancer, died from liver metastasis within 2 yr.

 The relation between the presence of calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta, as detected on chest x-rays, and the development of cardiovascular disease is examined during 12 years of follow-up of the Framingham cohort (n = 5,209).
 The prevalence of aortic calcified plaques approximately doubled with each decade of age, with only a trivial male predominance.
 Its presence was associated with a twofold increase in risk of cardiovascular death in men and women younger than age 65, even after other risk factors were taken into account.
 Similar increases in risk were found for coronary artery disease, stroke and intermittent claudication among middle-aged women.
 In middle-aged men these risks were less marked.
 The predictive value of aortic calcified plaques generally diminished with age.
 Risk of sudden coronary death in men with calcified plaques in the thoracic aorta ranged from a sevenfold increase at age 35 to no excess risk at age 70 years.
 These results support the view that atherosclerosis is a generalized process.
 The finding of aortic calcified plaques in a relatively young subject on a routine chest x-ray should be regarded as a sign for potential development of clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease in the cardiac, cerebral and peripheral arterial circulation.

"Quantification of biomedical findings of chronic pain patients: development of an index of pathology.
 Difficulties in assessing and quantifying the biomedical signs and symptoms that may be related to patients' reports of pain are well recognized.
 Although there appears to be some consensus among physicians as to the potential utility of examination and diagnostic tests frequently used to evaluate chronic pain patients, little attention has been paid to the reliability of interpreting the results of these procedures.
 Moreover, the integration of biomedical findings to form a general index of pathology associated with chronic pain has been a difficult problem to solve because not all biomedical procedures used to evaluate pain patients are necessarily relevant or indicated for a specific patient.
 Two studies are presented that were designed to evaluate the reliability of 23 biomedical procedures commonly used to evaluate chronic pain patients and to determine if findings on these procedures can effectively be combined to form a reliable index of physical pathology.
 The results of study 1 suggest that 17 of the 23 procedures can be applied in clinical setting with acceptable levels of reliability.
 Study 2 provides evidence that an innovative weighted scoring approach, based on current medical consensus, can be used to produce a reliable, general index of pathology that is independent of the number of procedures used to evaluate patients.
 The utility of this quantification approach to biomedical findings for clinical and research purposes is discussed.

"Effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. A meta-analysis by anatomic location of infarction  [published erratum appears in Ann Intern Med 1991 Mar 15;114(6):522] 
 PURPOSE: To determine the effect of intravenous streptokinase on early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior and acute inferior myocardial infarctions.
 DATA IDENTIFICATION: A literature search of English-language studies on the use of intravenous streptokinase in the treatment of suspected acute myocardial infarction for the period 1966 to 1989 using Medlars II and the bibliographies of relevant articles.
 In a number of instances, additional details on early mortality by location of myocardial infarction were provided by the authors.
 STUDY SELECTION: Of 140 originally identified articles, 6 that specifically met our inclusion criteria were selected: randomized trials that used intravenous streptokinase in a dose of 1.5 million units, with or without additional agents, compared with a group that differed only by the absence of streptokinase.
 Trials were selected by review of the methods section without regard for the results.
 DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two observers using specific methodologic criteria for infarct location and early mortality.
 After they conferred, the observers agreed completely on the data.
 RESULTS OF DATA SYNTHESIS: Among the 9155 patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction, the mortality rate in the control group was 17.4%.
 In contrast, patients treated with streptokinase had a 12.5% mortality.
 The mean risk difference was -4.8% (95% CI, -7.5% to -2.1%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.72 (CI, 0.65 to 0.79).
 A total of 9650 patients with suspected inferior infarction had a mortality rate in the control group of 7.6% [corrected].
 The mortality for streptokinase-treated patients was 6.6%.
 The mean risk difference was -0.8% (CI, -1.8% to 0.2%) and the summary risk ratio was 0.87 (CI, 0.76 to 1.01).
 CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous streptokinase clearly confers a protective effect against early mortality in patients with suspected acute anterior myocardial infarction.
 The magnitude of this effect is on the order of a 5% absolute reduction in risk of death by 21 to 35 days.
 For these patients, 21 need to be treated to save 1 additional life.
 For patients with suspected acute inferior infarction, the benefit of treatment on reducing early mortality is of smaller magnitude and less certain.
 These patients have an estimated absolute reduction of early mortality of approximately 1%, which would require treating 125 patients to save 1 additional life.

"Blood pressure response to dietary calcium intervention in humans.
 Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that dietary calcium deficiency may lead to the development of hypertension.
 This article reviews findings in human trials on calcium intervention with special reference to the responses of blood pressure and biochemical variables.
 Calcium supplementation consistently resulted in decreased blood pressure in a subset of hypertensive and normotensive subjects, but led to increased blood pressure in some hypertensive patients.
 The variable blood pressure responses to calcium supplementation could not be predicted on the basis of routine biochemical parameters and appeared to be due to differences in the backgrounds of the subjects and/or the design and size of the trials.
 It is concluded that further studies are required on the hypotensive effect of calcium supplementation.

"Cancer in the families of children with soft tissue sarcoma.
 The cancer experience among 754 first-degree relatives (mothers, fathers, and siblings) of a population-based series of 177 children with soft tissue sarcoma is reported.
 The current study represents an extension of our earlier work in which the authors found an excess of breast cancer in the mothers of 143 of these children.
 There were 40 cancers among all first-degree relatives, compared with 24.82 expected (relative risk [RR] 1.61, P = 0.006).
 There was no excess in fathers, but an excess of borderline significance was seen in mothers (RR 1.67, P = 0.0545), and a significant excess in siblings (RR 4.55, P = 0.0002), mainly due to carcinoma of the breast and pediatric tumors.
 Results of a step forward Cox multivariate analysis identified three variables in the index child which were independently associated with high cancer risk in relatives, as follows: age younger than 24 months at diagnosis; histologic type, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma or other and unspecified soft tissue sarcoma; and male sex.
 It was possible, therefore, to identify a subgroup of children whose relatives are at high risk of early onset cancer (RR in this group 10.14).
 The pattern of cancers is consistent with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.
 The authors conclude that a marked proportion of childhood soft tissue sarcoma has a genetic basis.

 Daytime intragastric acidity was higher in smokers with a median pH (interquartile range) of 1.56 (1.34-1.80) than in nonsmokers, who had a median pH of 1.70 (1.45-1.97) (P less than 0.001).
 There was no difference in 24-hr and nighttime median pH between the two groups.
 The small difference in daytime intragastric acidity in smokers and nonsmokers is unlikely to account for the increased prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in smokers.
 The analysis of smoking status in duodenal ulcer patients and healthy controls and males and females supports the general trend towards higher daytime acidity in smokers.
 Again, no differences in pH during the 24-hr or night period were found between the groups.
 The epidemiological and clinical correlation between smoking and duodenal ulcer disease is not adequately explained by increased intragastric acidity.

"Lack of cutaneous hyperemia in response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in IDDM.
 Cutaneous blood flow was measured with the laser Doppler technique and by recording cutaneous O2 tension on the forearm and forehead in nine young adult patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and nine sex- and age-matched healthy control subjects after induction of hypoglycemia.
 In the healthy subjects, cutaneous blood flow measured with the laser Doppler technique was increased by 120 +/- 26% in the forehead (P less than 0.01) and 196 +/- 50% in the forearm (P less than 0.01) at the glucose nadir (blood glucose 1.8 +/- 0.2 mM) compared with basal blood flow.
 In contrast, in diabetic patients, cutaneous blood flow was unchanged.
 The corresponding changes, at the glucose nadir, with cutaneous O2 tension recordings were 286 +/- 131% (P less than 0.05) in control subjects and -22 +/- 15% (NS) in diabetic patients.
 An impairment of sympathetic nervous function, not detectable by simple cardiovascular tests, could be responsible for the lack of cutaneous hyperemia and sweating and could contribute to unawareness of hypoglycemia in diabetic patients.

"Low level atmospheric sulfur dioxide pollution and childhood asthma.
 Quarterly analysis (1983-1987) of childhood asthma in Hong Kong from 13,620 hospitalization episodes in relation to levels of pollutants (SO2, NO2, NO, O3, TSP, and RSP) revealed a seasonal pattern of attack rates that correlates inversely with exposure to sulfur dioxide (r = -.52, P less than .05).
 The same cannot be found with other pollutants.
 Many factors may contribute to the seasonal variation of asthma attacks.
 We speculate that prolonged exposure (in terms of months) to low level SO2 is one factor that might induce airway inflammation and bronchial hyperreactivity and predispose to episodes of asthma.

"The efficacy of brainstem auditory evoked potentials in acoustic tumor surgery.
 As the identification of patients with small acoustic neuromas and salvageable hearing increases, intraoperative auditory nerve monitoring has been used increasingly in an attempt to improve the hearing preservation rate.
 Far-field recordings obtained by brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), at times enhanced by electrocochleography, have become a standard method of intraoperative auditory nerve assessment.
 To evaluate the usefulness of this monitoring technique, the hearing preservation results of a series of unmonitored acoustic tumor removals were compared to a series of patients monitored via the standard brainstem auditory evoked potentials.
 With comparable average tumor sizes, 4 of 7 unmonitored patients had hearing preserved at preoperative levels compared to 4 of 9 monitored patients.
 Neither preoperative BAEP assessments nor absolute tumor size were predictive of hearing preservation.
 This report brings into question the effectiveness of far-field intraoperative BAEP monitoring during acoustic tumor resection and suggests that direct auditory nerve monitoring may be more appropriate.

"Microspectrophotometric DNA analysis in ulcerative colitis with special reference to its application in diagnosis of carcinoma and dysplasia.
 The deoxyribonucleic (DNA) content was measured by microspectrophotometry in 100 specimens from 60 patients with ulcerative colitis, including six patients in whom the colitis was associated with carcinoma.
 Some 23 of 30 (77%) specimens of dysplastic tissue showed aneuploidy or polyploidy, whereas 50 of 53 (94%) specimens of non-dysplastic tissue showed diploidy.
 The difference was statistically significant (p less than 0.001).
 Polyploidy was often observed in non-dysplastic mucosa from patients who had carcinoma or dysplasia.
 In the non-dysplastic patients all samples of inflamed tissue showed diploidy.
 Some 10% of samples without inflammation, however, also showed polyploidy.
 A good correlation was found between the frequency of polyploid cells and the grade of dysplasia.
 Microspectrophotometric measurement of DNA content proved useful in the assessment and diagnosis of dysplasia in ulcerative colitis and could be considered for screening high risk patients.

"Two-way factorial study of alcohol and salt restriction in treated hypertensive men.
 The aim of this study was to determine whether moderate restriction of dietary salt intake leads to an additional fall in blood pressure in treated hypertensive men who are asked to simultaneously reduce their usual alcohol intake.
 Sixty-three subjects entered an initial 2-week familiarization period during which they continued their usual alcohol intake and commenced a ""low sodium"" diet (less than 60 mmol/day) supplemented with 100 mmol sodium chloride per day as enteric-coated tablets.
 Subjects were then randomly assigned to either drink a low alcohol beer alone for a 4-week period (reducing their self-reported alcohol consumption from 537 to 57 ml/week) or to continue their usual alcohol intake (543 versus 557 ml/week).
 Within the low and normal alcohol intake groups, subjects were assigned to either a low or normal sodium intake.
 The low sodium groups continued the sodium-restricted diet but were switched to placebo sodium chloride tablets for the 4 weeks.
 This resulted in a fall in the 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from 144 to 69 mmol/day.
 The normal sodium groups continued the low sodium diet but kept taking 100 mmol/day of the sodium chloride tablets, and their urinary sodium excretion remained unchanged (125 versus 142 mmol/day).
 Regular antihypertensive therapy was continued throughout.
 Fifty-nine subjects completed the trial.
 In those who reduced their alcohol intake there was a fall in both systolic blood pressure (-5.4 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (-3.2 mm Hg supine, p less than 0.01).

"Increased MEPP frequency as an early sign of experimental immune-mediated motoneuron disease.
 Intracellular recordings of miniature end-plate potentials were performed in extensor digitorum longus muscles from guinea pigs with experimental immune-mediated motoneuron destruction.
 In the early stages of the disease, the miniature end-plate potential frequency was elevated compared to that in control and normal animals.
 The amplitude and time course of the miniature end-plate potentials as well as the resting potential of the muscle fibers were not altered, which implies integrity of the postjunctional membrane.
 The increase in frequency of miniature end-plate potential reflects an increase of basal acetylcholine release and documents dysfunction of the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction.
 The increased frequency was associated with high levels of antimotoneuronal IgG in the blood and the presence of IgG at motor end-plates.
 These data suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction may be involved in the immune attack in animal models of motoneuron degeneration.

 Of 180 patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) seen at the University of Pittsburgh and affiliated hospitals since 1975, 21 of 100 tested positive for the anti-Jo-1 antibody.
 Sixteen of the 21 patients were women and 18 were white.
 Fifteen had adult PM, 4 had myositis in overlap with scleroderma, and 2 had adult DM.
 Evidence of interstitial lung disease was found in 12 of 18 anti-Jo-1 positive patients (67%), but in only 15 of 79 anti-Jo-1 negative patients (19%) (P less than 0.0002).
 The 21 anti-Jo-1 positive patients were divided into 3 separate groups based on the observed articular findings.
 Four patients had a deforming, predominantly nonerosive arthropathy with subluxations of the distal interphalangeal joints, especially the thumbs.
 Eight patients had a nondeforming arthropathy primarily affecting the small joints of the hands, wrists, shoulders, and knees.
 Those with deformities had a longer duration of arthritis compared with those with nondeforming arthropathy (mean 14.5 years versus 3.3 years).
 Nine anti-Jo-1 positive patients had no joint arthropathy.
 Three of 4 patients with deformities have required articular reconstructive surgery for subluxation, with 2 having associated subcutaneous calcinosis.

"The impact of microinvasion on axillary node metastases and survival in patients with intraductal breast cancer.
 A rational approach to the local treatment of intraductal breast cancer continues to generate considerable debate.
 However, the finding of an invasive component in intraductal breast cancer is widely regarded as an appropriate indication for axillary node dissection as part of the local treatment and staging of this disease.
 Despite this view, the natural history of patients with intraductal breast cancer with foci of microinvasion is poorly defined.
 Between 1965 and 1988, 41 patients with this pathologic finding of intraductal carcinoma with foci of microinvasion were seen at the UCLA Medical Center.
 Twenty-three patients presented with mammographic abnormalities, while 17 patients presented with a palpable mass.
 One patient presented with Paget's disease of the nipple.
 Thirty-three patients underwent axillary node dissection as part of their local treatment.
 No lymph node metastases were identified.
 The median follow-up in 37 patients was 47 months.
 There have been no local recurrences and no deaths from recurrent breast cancer.
 Intraductal breast cancer associated with microinvasion appears to be an extremely favorable lesion with minimal risk of nodal metastases.

"The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in young patients.
 An international survey identified 40 patients less than 20 years old who underwent surgical implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD).
 There was a history of aborted sudden cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia in 92.5% of these patients.
 Twenty-two patients (55%) had structural heart disease; dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were the most common diagnoses.
 Eighteen patients (45%) had primary electrical abnormalities including seven with the congenital long QT syndrome.
 There were no perioperative deaths associated with device implantation.
 Concomitant drug therapy was administered to 75% of the patients.
 Defibrillator discharge occurred in 70% of the patients, with 17 patients (42.5%) receiving at least one appropriate shock.
 There were two sudden and two nonsudden deaths at 28.2 months' median follow-up.
 Sudden death-free survival rates by life table analysis at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.88, respectively.
 Total survival rates at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.82, respectively.

"Is arterial proximity a valid indication for arteriography in penetrating extremity trauma? A prospective analysis.
 Three hundred seventy-three patients with a penetrating extremity injury were studied to assess the yield of arteriography.
 Patients underwent arteriography if any of the following was present: bruit, history of hemorrhage or hypotension, fracture, hematoma, decreased capillary refill, major soft-tissue injury, or nerve or pulse deficit.
 In the absence of these findings, arteriography was performed if the injury was in ""proximity"" to a major neurovascular bundle.
 In 216 patients, arteriography was performed when an abnormal finding was noted.
 Sixty-five injuries were identified, 19 requiring intervention.
 Proximity was the indication for arteriography in 157 patients.
 Seventeen injuries were identified, of which one required repair.
 In penetrating extremity trauma, the need for arteriography is based on clinical findings.
 The use of arteriography to screen for an arterial injury when proximity alone is the indication rarely identifies a significant injury and should be abandoned.

"Systems analysis of cerebrovascular pressure transmission: an observational study in head-injured patients.
 In an observational study in head-injured patients, cerebrovascular pressure transmission was investigated using a systems analysis approach whereby the blood pressure (BP) waveform was used as a measure of an input stimulus to the cerebrovascular bed (CVB) and the intracranial pressure (ICP) waveform as the response to that stimulus.
 The transfer function is a measure of how much pressure is transmitted through the CVB at a given frequency and is calculated using Fourier analysis of the pressure waveforms.
 The transfer function allows quantification of the pressure transmission performance of the CVB, thus providing a basis for comparison between normal and abnormal function.
 Fifteen hundred samples of ICP and BP waveforms were collected from 30 head-injured patients via microcomputer.
 Off-line spectral analysis of the waveform database revealed four main classes of transfer function: those with an overall flat transfer function (curve type 1); those with an elevated low-frequency response (curve type 2); those with an elevated high-frequency response (curve type 3); and those exhibiting both an elevated low- and high-frequency response (curve type 4).
 Curve types 2 and 4 were most often associated with raised ICP (greater than 20 mm Hg), whereas curve types 1 and 3 were most often affiliated with ICP less than 15 mm Hg.
 Studies of this type may provide insight into the pathophysiology of the CVB and ultimately aid in the prediction and treatment of raised ICP.

"Duodenogastric reflux and gastric histology after cholecystectomy with or without sphincteroplasty.
 Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa.
 Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography.
 The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach.
 There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01).
 The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005).
 Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients.
 These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage.

"Close correlation of intra-abdominal fat accumulation to hypertension in obese women.
 The relation between intra-abdominal visceral fat accumulation and blood pressure was investigated in 67 obese women (mean body mass index, 33.6 +/- 3.1; average age, 50 +/- 11 years).
 As an index of intra-abdominal fat accumulation, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area was determined using a computed tomographic section at the level of the umbilicus.
 When the obese subjects were divided into a hypertensive group and a normotensive group, the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area in the hypertensive group was significantly higher (0.53 +/- 0.33 versus 0.29 +/- 0.12, p less than 0.01).
 Significant correlations between the ratio of intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area and systolic blood pressure (r = 0.62, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.53, p less than 0.001) also were found.
 However, no significant difference existed in either the body mass index or the waist-to-hip circumference ratio between the hypertensive and normotensive groups.
 Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels were not significantly different between the two groups.
 Moreover, the correlation between the ratio of the intra-abdominal visceral fat area to subcutaneous fat area ratio and blood pressure was found independent of age and body mass index by multiple regression analyses.
 We conclude that intra-abdominal fat accumulation itself may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in obesity.

"Estrogen replacement and coronary artery disease. Effect on survival in postmenopausal women.
 The relationship among postmenopausal estrogen use, coronary stenosis, and survival was examined retrospectively in 2268 women undergoing coronary angiography.
 The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy.
 Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis.
 Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens.
 Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 ""ever users."" Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users.
 The ""never users"" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%).
 Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables.
 Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women.
 We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease.

"Serologic determinants of survival in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
 Specific circulating serum proteins may reflect unique properties governing the growth and progression of head and neck cancers.
 One hundred three previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were prospectively evaluated for serum IgA, IgG, and IgM and C1q-binding macromolecules.
 Immunoglobulins were assessed by the immunoturbidimetric technique.
 C1q-binding macromolecules (C1qBM) were measured utilizing the iodine-125 assay of Zubler et al (J Immunol 1976; 116: 232-5).
 Neither the level of serum immunoglobulins nor C1qBM values were correlated with the primary site, AJC (American Joint Committee on Cancer) stage of disease, or size of primary lesion.
 Likewise, comparison of serum IgA with C1qBM values demonstrated that these laboratory parameters were independent variables (r = 0.15 by Pearson linear regression).
 Univariate statistical analysis, utilizing the Cox proportional hazard model, showed serum IgA and C1qBM values to each contribute significantly to the ability to predict survival in patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (p = 0.01 and 0.003, respectively).
 Furthermore, multivariate analysis reveals that both C1qBM and serum IgA levels contribute significantly to the hazards model beyond staging in predicting survival (p less than 0.001).
 Predictive results were most apparent in patients with stage IV disease and related to the probability of both regional and distant metastatic recurrences.
 Conversely, serologic analysis provided no information in patients who were staged early.
 These results support pretreatment multiparametric serologic analysis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.

 Three intercostal nerves on the right side of growing rabbits were resected partially.
 From 1 to 3 months later, moderate left-convex thoracic scoliosis with rotation of vertebrae had developed, and the sagittal curvatures of the spine had diminished.
 In one group of these animals, a mechanically produced increase of 1 cm in the length of one rib on the side of the convexity resulted in an immediate correction of the scoliotic deformity, an improvement that was still evident 3 weeks after the operation.
 In two other groups of rabbits, a further resection of three intercostal nerves, this time on the left convex side, 1 and 2 months after the first operation, resulted in regression of scoliosis or halted its progression.
 These results further support a new concept in which the precipitating factor in the development of scoliosis is ascribed to asymmetric longitudinal growth of the ribs.
 They also suggest that regulation of the rib length could be a promising approach to the effective correction of progressive scoliosis at an early stage in man.

 Ninety-seven surgically excised natural cardiac valves were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray energy spectroscopy to assess the occurrence of crystalline deposits that contain the element silicon.
 Valves examined included 33 mitral valves, 63 aortic valves, and 1 tricuspid valve.
 To reduce the possibility of surface contamination, the deep layers of some valves were examined after exposure by fracture of the valve.
 Crystalline material containing silicon was observed in the deep tissue.
 Such crystalline material was sometimes entwined within subendothelial fibers.
 Crystalline deposits that contained silicon were associated with 34 of 97 of these valves (35%).

"Rearrangement of immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor, and bcl-2 genes in malignant lymphomas in Hong Kong.
 The pattern of malignant lymphomas in the Hong Kong Chinese population is characterized by a low incidence of Hodgkin's disease and follicular lymphomas.
 The authors studied the immunoglobulin (Ig), T-cell receptor (TCR), and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in 62 cases of malignant lymphoma in this population by Southern blot hybridization.
 Two cases of Hodgkin's disease showed no rearrangement of the Ig and TCR genes.
 All 42 cases of B-cell lymphoma had Ig heavy chain (JH) rearrangement with or without additional rearrangement of the light chains (C kappa and C lambda).
 One case of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had additional T-cell receptor beta-chain (C beta) rearrangement.
 Sixteen of 18 cases of T-cell lymphoma had C beta rearrangement, and one case of T-lymphoblastic lymphoma had additional JH rearrangement.
 Two of eight (25%) cases of follicular lymphoma but only one of the 34 (2.9%) cases of diffuse B-cell lymphoma had bcl-2 rearrangement that was detected by pFL-1 probe.
 None of the 62 cases showed bcl-2 rearrangement using the pFL-2 probe.
 In conclusion, the Ig and TCR gene rearrangement pattern of the lymphomas found in Hong Kong correlates well with the T-cell and B-cell lineage, which is similar to reports in the white population.
 However, the incidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement in follicular B-cell lymphoma is lower than that reported in the US but comparable with that in Japan.

"Fatal or severely disabling cerebral infarction during hospitalization for stroke or transient ischemic attack.
 Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day.
 These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion.
 Only one patient survived.
 Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy.
 Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued.
 No coagulation abnormalities were documented.
 We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients.

"Endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy revisited.
 Arytenoidectomy is currently the most reliable method of treating patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis.
 Although both endoscopic and external approaches have been described, the endoscopic laser technique is more desirable because it requires no incision and allows for the immediate assessment of airway size.
 Eleven patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis treated by endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy were presented in 1984.
 At that time, 10 of the 11 patients had been successfully decannulated.
 Follow-up on that group of patients revealed that 7 of the 10 successfully treated patients remain decannulated with a good airway, although 2 of these patients required a revision procedure to excise a granuloma.
 One patient failed at 15 months and has failed two subsequent revision operations, and 2 patients have been lost to follow-up.
 Since 1984, 17 additional patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis have been treated by the authors using the same endoscopic laser arytenoidectomy technique; all have been successfully managed, with a minimum follow-up of 3 years.

"Interventional radiology of the biliary tract. Transcholecystic intervention.
 Diagnostic and therapeutic biliary intervention by percutaneous access to the gallbladder is an important new area in interventional radiology.
 The anatomy of the gallbladder, biliary tree, and surrounding viscera is reviewed in this article as a preliminary to discussion of the diagnostic techniques of aspiration, cholangiography, biopsy, and the therapeutic techniques of gallbladder drainage and cholelithotomy.
 Recently there has been a bewildering proliferation of procedures aimed at removal, fragmentation, and dissolution of gallbladder stones.
 Several of these are discussed in this article.
 Removal of common bile duct stones by percutaneous cholecystostomy also is discussed.

"Randomized crossover study of effect of resistance training on glycemic control, muscular strength, and cholesterol in type I diabetic men.
 The goal of this study was to evaluate a program of resistance weight training on cardiovascular risk factors, blood glucose management, and overall strength in diabetic subjects.
 A randomized crossover design was performed on eight male type I (insulin-dependent) diabetic subjects (mean +/- SD age 31 +/- 3.5 yr, height 176 +/- 5.6 cm, body wt 80 +/- 15 kg, duration of diabetes 12.3 +/- 9.8 yr, and insulin dose 24 U NPH/day and 21 U regular/day).
 The program consisted of heavy-resistance weight training 3 days/wk for 10 wk, concentrating on the strengthening of major muscle groups through progressive resistance.
 Blood tests included total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and HbA1c.
 These tests were repeated at three time points during the program.
 Field-strength testing was performed before and after training.
 An improvement was seen in the squat (93.6% increase, P less than 0.0001) and bench press (58% increase, P less than 0.005).
 HbA1c and triglyceride levels showed no change during the resting portion of the experiment but showed a significant change with the training program: HbA1c 6.9 +/- 1.4 vs 5.8 +/- 0.9% (P = 0.05) and triglyceride 5.044 +/- 1.06 vs.
 4.628 +/- 0.88 mM (P = 0.01).
 Self-monitored glucose (taken pre- and postexercise) showed a decrease from 7.85 +/- 3.13 to 7.05 +/- 2.91 mM (P = 0.0001).
 Very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides did not change after training.
 Analysis of variance showed no significant differences over time from the three time points with regard to reductions in cardiovascular risk factors or HbA1c.

"Comparative airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects.
 Bradykinin, kallidin (lys-bradykinin), and [des-Arg9]bradykinin are oligopeptides that may contribute as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma by interacting with specific receptors designated B1 and B2.
 In this study, we have investigated the airway response to inhaled bradykinin, kallidin, and [des-Arg9]bradykinin in normal and asthmatic subjects.
 Changes in airway caliber were followed as maximum expiratory flow at 30% of the vital capacity (Vp30) and as forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1).
 Only one of the six normal subjects responded to bradykinin at the maximum cumulative concentration (5.33 mg/ml).
 Neither kallidin nor [des-Arg9]bradykinin had any measurable bronchoconstrictor effect in the normal subjects whether airway caliber was measured as Vp30 or FEV1.
 In the 10 subjects with asthma, bradykinin and kallidin, but not [des-Arg9]bradykinin, produced a concentration-related fall in FEV1.
 The geometric mean provocation concentrations of inhaled agonist reducing FEV1 by 20% of baseline were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.44 mg/ml for bradykinin, kallidin, and histamine, respectively.
 Bronchoconstriction produced by bradykinin and kallidin was maximal within 3 to 5 min with recovery occurring over 30 to 45 min.
 Because bradykinin and kallidin are agonists of B2 receptors and [des-Arg9]bradykinin is an agonist for B1 receptors, these in vivo structure activity studies suggest that asthmatic, but not normal, airways are hyperresponsive to kinins when compared to histamine and that this potent bronchoconstrictor action is a specific pharmacologic effect compatible with the stimulation of B2 receptors or a variant of these.

"A clinicopathologic study of the eyes in familial adenomatous polyposis with extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome).
 The eyes of a 51-year-old woman with familial adenomatous polyposis and extracolonic manifestations (Gardner's syndrome) were obtained postmortem and studied by light microscopy and by transmission and scanning electron microscopy.
 We found a generalized abnormality in melanogenesis of the retinal pigment epithelium and at least three types of pigmented lesions.
 The histologic findings in one type of lesion were consistent with congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium or benign pigmented nevus of the retinal pigment epithelium.
 The other two types of lesion were most consistent with hamartomatous malformations of the retinal pigment epithelium featuring cellular hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and rarely retinal invasion and formation of a minute mushroom-shaped tumor.
 These histopathologic findings indicate a generalized effect of the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on the retinal pigment epithelium.
 This oncogene, which is responsible for tumor formation in the gastrointestinal tract, soft tissues, bone, and other locations in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, also leads to a generalized defect in melanogenesis and focal lesions of the retinal pigment epithelium.

"Endoscopic management of early supraglottic cancer.
 An initial endoscopic surgical approach to early supraglottic cancer provides the surgeon with the ability to accurately stage these lesions, avoiding possible undertreatment while allowing for a valuable treatment option for those supraglottic cancers with histologically incontrovertibly superficial disease.
 Early invasion of the preepiglottic and paraglottic spaces can be determined accurately without altering or delaying any treatment option (open surgical excision, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy).
 The tendency of supraglottic cancers to transgress the natural foramina of the epiglottis is well established, and the concern about this depth of invasion is reflected by the 1977 revised staging criteria, which required assessment of the preepiglottic space (PES).
 Along with the microscope and the carbon dioxide laser, the adjustable supraglottiscope facilitates the determination of PES invasion and facilitates en bloc excision of superficial supraglottic cancers.
 The resulting morbidity typically is no different from that with routine direct endoscopy and biopsy.

"Angiocentric lymphoma with histologic features of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with predominant respiratory and hematologic manifestations. Report of a case and review of the literature 
 Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare fatal disease characterized by widespread intravascular proliferations of neoplastic mononuclear cells.
 Clinically, dermatologic and bizarre neurologic manifestations usually predominate.
 The origin of the neoplastic cells remains still undetermined.
 The authors report a patient with NAE peculiar with respect to the following points: (1) the patient predominantly manifested respiratory symptoms and hematologic findings and lacked cutaneous or neurologic manifestations; and (2) immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies showed the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells, although previous cases with predominant respiratory or hematologic manifestations were reported to be of endothelial origin.
 Despite the rarity, this type of NAE or angiocentric lymphoma should be recognized because it is easily confused with other disorders, particularly vasculitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

"Ultrastructural evidence for differentiation in a human glioblastoma cell line treated with inhibitors of eicosanoid metabolism.
 Human glioblastoma cells incubated in the presence of inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis show decreased cellular proliferation without cytotoxicity.
 We studied the ultrastructural morphology of a human glioblastoma cell line cultured with nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a lipoxygenase inhibitor, or 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, a cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor.
 When glioblastoma cells were treated for 3 days with antiproliferative concentrations of either agent, they shared many morphological characteristics, including evidence for increased astrocytic differentiation with only limited signs of toxicity.
 The inhibited glioma cells demonstrated an increase in the number and length of astrocytic processes containing greater numbers of glial filaments, and the NDGA-treated cells also demonstrated extensive lateral pseudopod formation along the processes.
 The glioblastoma cell shape also became more elongated, losing the usual nuclear lobularity and nuclear inclusions, especially in NDGA-treated cells.
 Many cytoplasmic organelles packed the cytosol of the inhibited glioma cells, including prominent Golgi apparatus, dilated smooth endoplasmic reticulum evolving into dilated vesicles, cytoplasmic vacuoles, and numerous concentric laminations.
 There was limited evidence for toxicity, however, as the mitochondria were more pleomorphic with some mitochondrial distention and disruption of the cristae along with an increase in cytoplasmic vacuolization.
 We conclude that the inhibitors of eicosanoid biosynthesis, NDGA and 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid, not only suppress glioblastoma cell proliferation, but also induce increased astrocytic differentiation.

"Local recurrence after curative resection of colorectal adenocarcinoma.
 A total of 853 patients with 861 colorectal adenocarcinomas were operated on at our institution between 1965 and 1981.
 Complete follow-up information was obtained in all but six patients (99.4%), and all available histologic slides were reviewed to determine pathologic stage and characteristics.
 Six hundred fifty-one patients (76.3%) underwent a potentially curative procedure, and their operative mortality rate was 2.8%.
 Of the 627 patients available for analysis, 50 (8%) had a local recurrence.
 The median time to local recurrence was 18 months, and only 16% of local recurrences were diagnosed 5 years after the original resection.
 Median survival of patients with a local recurrence was 3 1/2 years from the original resection, and 16 patients (32%) survived 5 years or longer.
 A multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the influence of several clinical and pathologic characteristics on local recurrence among Dukes' stages B and C adenocarcinomas (n = 539) after exclusion of patients with synchronous tumors (n = 8), postoperative deaths (n = 18), loss to follow-up (n = 6), or incomplete data (n = 11).
 This analysis revealed that the local recurrence rate was significantly related to depth of invasion (B1 + C1 = 0%; B2 + C1 = 10%; p less than 0.01), site of origin (right plus transverse colon = 6%; left plus rectosigmoid colon = 10%; rectum = 12%; p less than 0.05), and lymphatic or capillary microinvasion (absent, 6%; present, 14%; p less than 0.05).
 This analysis attempts to identify patients at high risk for development of local recurrent disease to select candidates for postoperative adjuvant therapy.

"Reconstruction of patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty with an extensor mechanism allograft.
 Although patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a rare complication, the consistently poor outcome of conventional tendon repair has convinced some to abandon such reconstruction in favor of a prospective protocol using an allograft distal extensor mechanism.
 The graft consists of a quadriceps tendon, a patella with a cemented prosthesis, a patellar tendon, and a tibial tubercle.
 Since December 1985, 13 knees in 12 patients were reconstructed using this method.
 Ten knees were followed for six to 51 months; five of these knees were followed for more than 24 months.
 Knee extension power and improved function were ultimately attained in all cases, although minimal extensor lags were present in three cases.
 Preoperative motion returned in all but one knee.
 Healing of the allograft to the host tissue was attained primarily at all of the tibial junctions.
 Two graft complications occurred, both in the first three months after surgery: one quadriceps junction treated by resuture failed at the one-month mark, and the other graft had to be revised for extensor weakness from rupture of the graft at the patella-patellar tendon junction, which was attributed to surgical damage to the tendon.
 After completion of healing to the host and rehabilitation of the knee joint, no grafts in the series failed during the course of normal daily activities.
 One patient fractured the allograft patella in a severe fall.
 The long-term durability of this construct needs to be studied further.

"HBV-DNA detection by gene amplification in acute hepatitis B.
 Serum samples from 62 women, inadvertently infected with hepatitis B virus in an in vitro fertilization program, were tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus-DNA using the polymerase chain reaction.
 Under conditions of a strict spatial separation of DNA extraction, amplification and product analysis, we succeeded in detection of as few as 360 hepatitis B virus particles per milliliter.
 Hepatitis B virus-DNA was detected with a high frequency during HBsAg and HBeAg antigenemia (98.5%) but also in the convalescent phase after appearance of antibody to HBsAg (18.2%).
 However, all patients with hepatitis B virus-DNA in convalescent sera were hepatitis B virus-DNA negative 3 to 6 mo later.
 All patients with HBeAg-positive samples showed hepatitis B virus-DNA positivity by polymerase chain reaction.
 For acute hepatitis, gene amplification restores the relationship between HBeAg and hepatitis B virus-DNA observed in serum from chronic hepatitis B patients and calls attention to the prolonged presence of hepatitis B virus-DNA in serum after generally accepted criteria for resolution of the infection have been reached.

"Cytomegalovirus in the setting of infection with human immunodeficiency virus 
 Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has several possible roles in the pathogenesis of AIDS.
 CMV causes a number of clinical syndromes, including retinitis, pneumonitis, and gastroenteritis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 In addition, CMV may potentiate the cellular immunodeficiency observed in patients with HIV infection either directly or through enhancement of HIV replication.
 Finally, CMV may predispose the host to bacterial or fungal infection by compromising the integrity of mucosal barriers to infection.
 Therapy with ganciclovir for CMV infection may result in a decrease in morbidity related to the virus, but problems with drug toxicity and resistance to the agent mandate the development of additional therapeutic approaches.

"Health locus of control beliefs and alcohol-related factors that may influence treatment outcomes.
 Treatment programs have based their treatment approach on the premise that alcoholics should exert internal control over situations and events that affect them.
 Since chronic alcohol use affects the health of an individual, Walston and Walston's Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale was administered to 47 alcoholics in a treatment program.
 The population reflected a higher belief that health status is more under their own control than under the control of chance or powerful others.
 However, the results indicated that recovering alcoholics with a more powerful other health orientation tended to maintain membership longer with Alcoholics Anonymous, would seek help sooner, would begin heavy drinking at a later age, and would attempt formal treatment more often.

 The spatial relations between bacteria and the affected tissues can indicate pathogenic mechanisms.
 This study was undertaken to define the spatial relation of Helicobacter pylori to the human gastric mucosa.
 Antibodies against gastric mucus and ruthenium red were used to stabilise the glycoprotein structure of the mucus and glycocalyces in antral biopsy specimens from eight patients infected with H pylori.
 The location of organisms and ultrastructural features were assessed using systematic scanning and transmission electron microscopy: 92 (2)% (mean (SE] of H pylori were in the pit mucus, and 7 (3)% were in the surface mucus; 60 (12)% of H pylori were close to epithelial cells, with only 5 (2)% located near the epithelial intercellular junctions.
 Fine filamentous strands extended between organisms and nearby epithelial cells, with few organisms in membrane to membrane contact.
 H pylori were not observed between, beneath, or within cells of the gastric mucosa.
 The preferred location of H pylori in the gastric antrum is within the pit mucus close to the epithelial cell surface, with no evidence that they have a direct toxic effect on the mucosa.

"Emergency department diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the accuracy of the history and physical examination as compared to the addition of serum progesterone screening for ectopic pregnancy in women presenting to the emergency department.
 DESIGN: Prospective, consecutive case series, N = 2,157.
 SETTING: ED of the Regional Medical Center at Memphis, a publicly subsidized, 450-bed acute care hospital staffed by residents and faculty of the University of Tennessee, Memphis.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All ED patients with a positive urine pregnancy test treated between January 1 and December 31, 1988.
 INTERVENTIONS: Screening history, physical examination, and serum progesterone (P) and quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) titer.
 MEASUREMENTS: All discharged patients were given follow-up appointments within two weeks; those found to have a P less than 25 ng/mL were called to return for repeat hCG and transvaginal ultrasound.
 MAIN RESULTS: One hundred sixty-one of 2,157 patients (7.5%) with a positive urine pregnancy test were found to have an ectopic pregnancy.
 All but five had a P of less than 25 ng/mL (sensitivity, 97%); four of these were admitted for immediate surgery because of symptoms.
 Overall, the ED physician detected 89 of 161 ectopics (55.3%) on initial presentation, 53 (60%) of which were ruptured at the time of surgery.
 Seventy-two patients (44.7%) who were discharged but later found to have an ectopic pregnancy had benign clinical presentations, including 41 with vaginal bleeding.
 There were no statistically significant differences in the presenting symptoms of patients with unruptured ectopics compared with normal intrauterine pregnancies.
 All but one of the 72 discharged patients were noted the following day to have a progesterone of less than 25 ng/mL and contacted to return.
 Eight of these were found to have a ruptured ectopic at the time of surgery.
 Only 91 of 161 patients (56.5%) with ectopic pregnancy acknowledged one or more clinical risk factors on follow-up questioning.
 CONCLUSION: The standard history and physical examination, including those performed by gynecologic specialists, are insufficiently sensitive for early detection of unruptured ectopic pregnancy.
 EDs with a high incidence of ectopic pregnancy should strongly consider implementation of a universal progesterone screening program to decrease unnecessary patient morbidity and the risk of mortality from undiagnosed ectopic pregnancy.

 We studied in vitro functional parameters of peripheral blood B-lymphocytes from severely burned patients (n = 10; burn injuries ranging from 25 to 72% TBSA).
 While the number of B-cells remained unchanged, B-cell proliferation induced by Staphylococcus aureus strain Cowan I (SAC) was normal or even enhanced at early and late phases postburn, but showed a marked suppression during the second to fourth week.
 A similar pattern was observed for the pokeweed mitogen (PWM)- or SAC-stimulated synthesis of immunoglobulin M (IgM), whereas IgG production was decreased over the whole postburn period monitored.
 Cytokine (interleukin 4)-induced B-cell activation as indicated by the expression of the CD23 surface antigen was impaired throughout the second to fifth week.
 In parallel, the release of the proteolytic cleavage product sCD23 which represents a B-cell growth and differentiation factor was reduced.
 Our data provide evidence that activation, proliferation, and differentiation processes of B-lymphocytes are impaired in severely burned patients, which may contribute to their enhanced susceptibility to infection and sepsis.

"Mental stress as an acute trigger of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction and blood pressure elevation in coronary artery disease.
 Acute mental stress may be a frequent trigger of transient myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death.
 In an experimental setting, the effect of mental stress on hemodynamics and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities (as detected by radionuclide ventriculography) was measured in 29 patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
 Seventy-five percent of the patients demonstrated mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities.
 Patients frequently exhibited greater increases in peak systolic arterial pressure during mental stress than during exercise.
 Personally relevant mental stress is the most potent type of mental stress, both in terms of frequency and magnitude of ischemia.
 Most mental stress-induced ischemic episodes are clinically and electrocardiographically silent and occur at heart rates significantly lower than those seen during exercise.
 Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased during mental stress-induced ischemia, suggesting that increased myocardial oxygen demand plays a role in the pathophysiology of mental stress-induced transient ischemia.
 The significant magnitude and acute onset of this mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation may in some manner contribute to atherosclerotic plaque rupture.
 These findings may provide a pathophysiologic link to the epidemiologic association between mental stress and acute ischemic coronary events.
 A new ambulatory radionuclide detector that can concurrently monitor left ventricular ejection fraction and electrocardiographic ST-segment change may enhance the detection and evaluation of transient myocardial ischemia in ambulatory coronary patients.

"Motor unit numbers and contractile properties after spinal cord injury.
 The number of motor units in the thenar muscle group was estimated in 11 patients with cervical spinal cord injuries.
 The surface electromyogram and twitch force, in response to maximal stimulation of the median nerve was divided by the average surface electromyogram and twitch of single units.
 The average single unit size was obtained by intramuscular microstimulation of motor nerve branches and by graded whole nerve stimulation, which provided three independent estimates, two based on the electromyogram and one based on force.
 The motor unit estimates from the patients covered a wide range.
 Some had essentially normal motor units both in numbers and contractile properties, while others had varying reductions in numbers of units.
 Those patients who showed a large reduction in motor unit numbers also had greatly enlarged units, which produced an average of up to sixfold the normal force.
 These enlarged units summed to produce maximal compound action potentials and twitches that were sometimes indistinguishable from normal.
 Magnetic resonance imaging scans of the cervical spine obtained from some patients provided independent evidence that patients with low motor unit counts had sustained direct injury to the anterior aspect of the spinal cord at the relevant segmental levels.
 Some patients showed a normal number of motor units long after the injury.
 No evidence of transneuronal degeneration could be demonstrated in the thenar group in these patients with the current techniques.

 An angiotensin II sensitivity test and a supine pressor test were done consecutively at 28 weeks gestation in 90 healthy, normotensive nulliparous women.
 None of the supine pressor tests was positive, applying the predefined threshold of a rise of 20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after rolling over; nine tests were positive using a corrected 9 mmHg cut-off level.
 Ten women had a positive angiotensin sensitivity test using a threshold of the effective pressor dose of 8 ng/kg/min; 22 women were positive using an effective pressor dose of less than or equal to 10 ng/kg/min.

 During the 10-yr period beginning January 1979, 59 infants and children with Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) were admitted to our hospital.
 Tracheostomies were performed in 15 patients and their records were reviewed.
 Fourteen patients were recalled for assessment of pulmonary function and respiratory muscle strength (RMS).
 The median duration of assisted ventilation (including endotracheal [ET] intubation) was 21 days and the median duration of tracheostomy was 39 days.

 Two new morphs (F and G) detected by the centromeric alpha satellite probe p alpha 10RP8 and D10Z1 in HinfI digests are linked to the PstI polymorphisms of D10Z1, confirming their chromosome 10 location.
 The F and G morphs were in strong linkage disequilibrium with each other but were in weak linkage disequilibrium with the A and B morphs defined in PstI digests.
 Data for haplotypes formed by using the A and F morphs improved the lod score for linkage between the disease locus for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A) and D10Z1 (Z = 14.06 at theta = 0) in the six large families studied by Wu et al.
 Furthermore, the locus that codes for a distinct phenotype, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with parathyroid tumors (PTs) and no pheochromocytomas (PHEOs) (referred to as MTC with PTs), in one of the families was closely linked to two markers, D10Z1 and RBP3, with lodscores of 2.86 and 3.54, respectively, at theta = 0.

 Using standard meta-analysis techniques, the overall pooled odds ratio for all the studies was 0.68 for the crude results (95% CI 0.58-0.78) and 0.73 for the adjusted results (95% CI 0.61-0.85).
 The graphical odd-man-out method produced a 94% interval of 0.70-0.72.
 The pooled odds ratio of the case-control studies was lower than for the longitudinal studies.
 However, subdividing studies by the type of case source produced a pooled odds ratio for studies using hospital-based cases of 0.49 (95% CI 0.39-0.63) which was considerably less than that of studies using population-based cases: 0.95 (0.78-1.16).
 This difference was unlikely to have explained by bias due to selection of controls.
 We suggest that OCP use may not have a ""protective effect"" on the development of RA but may prevent the progression to severe disease by modifying the disease process.

"Evidence for a secular change in obesity, height, and weight among Navajo Indian schoolchildren.
 A survey measuring heights and weights of 1969 schoolchildren residing on the Navajo Indian Reservation was conducted in 1989.
 The findings were compared with National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) reference data and with surveys of Navajo children from 1955, 1968, and 1981.
 Approximately twice as many children exceeded the 95th percentile of weight-for-age (11.2% of girls, 12.5% of boys) than would be expected for the NCHS reference population.
 The mean weight-for-height z scores exceeded those for the NCHS reference population for all ages in both sexes.
 Compared with data from 1955, mean heights increased 6.1% among boys and 4.4% among girls whereas mean weights increased 28.8% among boys and 18.7% among girls across all age groups.
 The data suggest that there has been a secular change in height, weight, and obesity in Navajo Indian children over the past 35 y.

"Undiagnosed tuberculosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection 
 We describe the clinical features of 11 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection in whom tuberculosis was undiagnosed and untreated prior to death.
 Most patients (9 of 11) had pulmonary complaints and 8 of 11 had roentgenographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis (hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, pleural effusion, apical infiltrate or miliary pattern).
 Despite these findings, tuberculin skin tests were not performed in any of the patients.
 Acid-fast smears of sputum were obtained in three cases and bronchoscopy performed in only four, reflecting the low index of suspicion for tuberculosis.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the presumptive diagnosis in nine cases but was confirmed in only one case.
 Autopsy revealed tuberculosis as the cause of death in four patients.
 Of the seven patients who did not undergo autopsy, disseminated tuberculosis, manifest by mycobacteremia, was the only life-threatening illness identified and probably contributed to death.
 Increased awareness of the clinical and roentgenographic features of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, combined with more intensive use of acid-fast smears and tuberculin skin testing, are necessary in order to decrease mortality from this treatable complication of HIV-infection.

 Asymptomatic cyst-like cortical defects appearing after fractures in children have been occasionally reported.
 Typically, these defects appear during fracture consolidation, within the newly formed subperiosteal bone, proximal to the fracture line, do not enlarge, and progressively disappear.
 We have previously shown a fatty density on CT scan within the early cortical defect.
 We now present two additional cases in which early CT scans appeared to confirm that these transient cortical defects may consist of fat, and probably result from the inclusion of medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma.

"Treatment selection for carcinoma of the base of the tongue.
 Between 1974 and 1984, 173 patients were treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue base.
 Fifty-four patients had T1 or T2 primaries, while 115 patients had T3 or T4 tumors (4 were not staged).
 Lymph node metastasis was present in 120 patients.
 Early primary tumors treated with surgery or radiotherapy had a control rate of 83% (5 of 6 tumors) and 89% (40 of 45 tumors), respectively.
 For advanced primary tumors, definitive radiotherapy produced a local control rate of 55% (42 of 76 tumors), compared with 79% (23 of 29 tumors) for surgery and postoperative radiotherapy.
 If primary control was obtained, the regional failure rate was less than 10%.
 Tumor growth patterns were predictive of the response to radiotherapy.
 The primary control rate at 2 years for 21 patients with exophytic tumors was 84% as opposed to 58% for 62 patients with ulcerative-infiltrative tumors (p = 0.04).
 Radiotherapy is effective for early stage or exophytic tumors, whereas for advanced or deeply invasive tumors combined therapy enhances local control.

 Of 221 patients with superficial bladder tumors (stages Ta, Tis and T1) treated by transurethral resection and an initial 6-week course of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) 195 were evaluated after 3 months for local response.
 Of these patients 17 (8.7%) had a stage T1 tumor, of whom 14 (82%) subsequently had muscle invasion (7), uncontrolled local disease (6) or metastasis (1).
 The median interval to progression was 8.4 months, which was significantly (p = 0.0001) less than among the other 178 patients with a nonstage T1 lesion or no tumor found at 3 months, of whom 44 (25%) had progression (median more than 5 years).
 These data suggest that patients with stage T1 tumor 3 months after BCG therapy require additional therapy other than simple tumor resection and meticulous followup.

"Prototype volume-controlled resuscitator for neonates and infants.
 Twenty-five infants receiving assisted ventilation in an ICU were manually ventilated for 5-min periods using either a new prototype volume-controlled resuscitator (VCR) or a standard self-inflating resuscitator (SIR).
 Variables monitored during these 5-min periods included heart rate, respiratory rate, mean arterial pressure, mean airway pressure (Paw), end-tidal CO2 (PetCO2), pulse oximetry oxygen saturation, PaO2, and PaCO2.
 Significant differences in posttrial values for the following variables were: a) PetCO2 (31.2 +/- 9.1 vs.
 25.6 +/- 8.2 torr, p less than .001); b) PaCO2 (38.0 +/- 4.9 vs.
 33.2 +/- 6.7 torr, p less than .01); and c) pH (7.4 +/- 0.6 vs.
 7.5 +/- 0.1, p less than .04) at comparable Paw (9.5 +/- 7.6 vs.
 8.0 +/- 6.0, NS).
 Eighty-four percent (21/25) of infants in the VCR group had normal PaCO2 values (35 to 45 torr) while only 44% (11/25) in the SIR group achieved normocarbia (p less than .001).
 Measurements of the highest (Pmax) and lowest (Pmin) inspiratory pressure (cm H2O) in 15 patients demonstrated marked variation in Pmax with the SIR.
 Differences in Pmax (SIR minus VCR) were significant (10.8 +/- 3.7, p less than .02) but not in Pmin (0.5 +/- 3.5, NS).
 Our study demonstrates that ventilation with the VCR resulted in less hyperventilation with minimal pressure variability as compared with the SIR.

"An immunohistochemical study of pi class glutathione S-transferase expression in normal human tissue.
 Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a family of isoenzymes that play an important role in protecting cells from cytotoxic and carcinogenic agents, can be separated by biochemical and immunologic characteristics into three distinct classes named alpha, mu, and pi.
 Previous studies have indicated that there is marked heterogeneity in the expression of different GST isoenzymes in different normal and malignant tissues.
 To better understand the regulation of the human pi class glutathione S-transferase isoenzyme (GST-pi), the tissue distribution of this protein wa studied by an immunohistochemical technique using an anti-GST-pi polyclonal antibody in normal paraffin-embedded human tissues.
 These studies indicate that there is a broad distribution of GST-pi in normal human tissues and establish a precise localization within the different organs studied.
 GST-pi was expressed predominantly in normal epithelial cells of the urinary, digestive, and respiratory tracts, suggesting a possible role for GST-pi in detoxication and elimination of toxic substances.
 Previous studies have indicated that GST-pi and the putative drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein are both overexpressed in multidrug-resistant human breast cancer cells and in xenobiotic resistant preneoplastic rat hyperplastic liver nodules.
 Results from this study indicate that there are also similarities between the normal tissue distribution GST-pi and that previously reported for mammalian P-glycoprotein, particularly in secretory epithelia.
 This finding suggests that these two gene products, which have been implicated in the development of resistance to cytotoxic drugs, may be coregulated in normal and malignant cells.

"Incidence of cervical spinal stenosis in professional and rookie football players.
 Sagittal canal/vertebral body ratios were measured on cervical spine lateral radiographs of 124 professional football players and 100 rookie football players.
 A total of 894 levels were measured in 224 players.
 Thirty-two percent (40) of the 124 professional football players, and 34% of the 100 rookies had a ratio of less than 0.80 at one or more levels from C3 to C6.
 The 0.80 ratio has been considered indicative of cervical spinal stenosis.
 This is the first time that the incidence of spinal stenosis, as determined by Torg's ratio, has been demonstrated in a population of professional and rookie football players.
 Because one-third of this population has cervical spinal stenosis as determined by the Torg ratio, other factors should be considered in the evaluation of a player with a transient quadriplegic episode when making continued play decisions.

"Erythrocyte fatty acids, plasma lipids, and cardiovascular disease in rural China.
 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality (coronary heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, and stroke), plasma lipids, and red blood cell fatty acid composition were examined in an ecologic study in 65 rural counties in the People's Republic of China.
 Means of plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were substantially lower and the ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol was higher in this Chinese population than in Western populations.
 Mortality rates for CVD in China were well below Western values.
 Within China neither plasma total cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol was associated with CVD.
 A strong inverse correlation between red blood cell oleate concentrations and CVD was observed.
 However, red blood cell oleate concentrations were not associated with plasma cholesterol but were strongly negatively associated with arachidonate concentrations, suggesting potential diminution of CVD by oleate through reduced platelet aggregability.
 The results indicate that geographical differences in CVD mortality within China are caused primarily by factors other than dietary or plasma cholesterol.

"Remote effect of deep-seated vascular brain lesions on cerebral blood flow.
 We measured regional cerebral blood flow using the xenon-133 inhalation method, at approximately 1 month after onset, in 60 stroke patients who had no evidence of major carotid artery stenosis or occlusion.
 Their single lesions (43 infarcts and 17 hematomas) were located in the capsulothalamolenticular region, sparing the cortex.
 Hemispheric mean cerebral blood flow was reduced on the side of the lesion in 25 patients and on both sides in 20.
 Regional hypoperfusion was observed in 46 patients (ipsilaterally in 34, bilaterally in 10, and contralaterally in two).
 Regional hypoperfusion was observed most frequently in the frontal lobe, particularly in the motor and premotor cortices of the prerolandic area.
 The 46 patients with regional hypoperfusion were compared with the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion, considering the size and location of the lesion as well as the functional and analytic motor performances.
 As a rule, the lesion was slightly smaller and more posterior and the functional (p less than 0.001) and analytic (p less than 0.05) motor performances were significantly better in the 14 patients without regional hypoperfusion.
 Since the xenon-133 inhalation method examines cortical blood flow, we can attribute blood flow reductions resulting from deep-seated lesions to a functional depression akin to diaschisis.
 Interpretation of the clinical consequences and pathogenesis of this phenomenon requires further sequential and pathologic studies.

"Biomechanics of mammalian terrestrial locomotion.
 Mammalian skeletons experience peak locomotor stresses (force per area) that are 25 to 50% of their failure strength, indicating a safety factor of between two and four.
 The mechanism by which animals achieve a constant safety factor varies depending on the size of the animal.
 Over much of their size (0.1 to 300 kilograms), larger mammals maintain uniform skeletal stress primarily by having a more upright posture, which decreases mass-specific muscle force by increasing muscle mechanical advantage.
 At greater sizes, increased skeletal allometry and decreased locomotor performance likely maintain stresses constant.
 At smaller sizes, skeletal stiffness may be more critical than strength.
 The decrease in mass-specific muscle force in mammals weighing 0.1 to 300 kilogram indicates that peak muscle stresses are also constant and correlates with a decrease in mass-specific energy cost of locomotion.
 The consistent pattern of locomotor stresses developed in long bones at different speeds and gaits within a species may have important implications for how bones adaptively remodel to changes in stress.

 We conducted a phase II clinical trial of fluorouracil (5FU) and recombinant interferon alfa-2a (rIFN alpha-2a) in 52 previously untreated patients with bidimensionally measurable metastatic colorectal cancer.
 During week 1, 5FU was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion, 750 mg/m2/d for 5 consecutive days.
 Intravenous bolus administration of 5FU 750 mg/m2 was given weekly for 7 weeks starting on day 12.
 rIFN alpha-2a (Roferon; Hoffman-LaRoche, Nutley, NJ), 9 x 10(6) U, was administered subcutaneously three times weekly during weeks 1 to 8.
 Patients were evaluated for response on week 9.
 Of 52 patients enrolled in the study, 51 were assessable for toxicity, and 45 were assessable for response.
 Fifteen patients experienced partial response, and one patient achieved a clinical complete response for an overall response rate of 35% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%, 50%).
 Median duration of response is 7.5 months (range, 4 to 11 months).
 Seventy percent of patients entered on the study are alive with a median follow-up duration of 7 months.
 Twenty-five percent of patients developed grade 4 toxicity, and 82% developed grade 3 toxicity.
 One drug-related death in the presence of sepsis was reported, and two treatment-related seizures occurred.
 Our experience with this schedule produced a lower response rate with greater toxicity than previously reported.
 Current randomized trials comparing this schedule of 5FU with rIFN alpha-2a to 5FU plus folinic acid (leucovorin) or single-agent 5FU may determine its role in the treatment of advanced colorectal carcinomas.

"Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation: no causal relation with diabetic autonomic neuropathy 
 OBJECTIVE--To examine the traditional view that unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus are manifestations of autonomic neuropathy.
 DESIGN--Perspective assessment of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and detailed assessment of autonomic neuropathy in patients with insulin dependent diabetes according to the adequacy of their hypoglycaemic counterregulation.
 SETTING--One routine diabetic unit in a university teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS--23 Patients aged 21-52 with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (seven with symptoms suggesting autonomic neuropathy, nine with a serious clinical problem with hypoglycaemia, and seven without symptoms of autonomic neuropathy and without problems with hypoglycaemia) and 10 controls with a similar age distribution, without a personal or family history of diabetes.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence of autonomic neuropathy as assessed with a test of the longest sympathetic fibres (acetylcholine sweatspot test), a pupil test, and a battery of seven cardiovascular autonomic function tests; adequacy of hypoglycaemic glucose counterregulation during a 40 mU/kg/h insulin infusion test; history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia; and response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide during hypoglycaemia, which depends on an intact and responding autonomic innervation of the pancreas.
 RESULTS--There was little evidence of autonomic neuropathy in either the 12 diabetic patients with a history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia or the seven patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation.
 By contrast, in all seven patients with clear evidence of autonomic neuropathy there was no history of unawareness of hypoglycaemia and in six out of seven there was adequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation.
 Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation were significantly associated (p less than 0.01).
 The response of plasma pancreatic polypeptide in the diabetic patients with adequate counterregulation but without autonomic neuropathy was not significantly different from that of the controls (change in plasma pancreatic polypeptide 226.8 v 414 pmol/l).
 The patients with autonomic neuropathy had a negligible plasma pancreatic polypeptide response (3.7 pmol/l), but this response was also blunted in the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation (72.4 pmol/l) compared with that of the controls (p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS--Unawareness of hypoglycaemia and inadequate glucose counterregulation during hypoglycaemia are related to each other but are not due to autonomic neuropathy.
 The blunted plasma pancreatic polypeptide responses of the patients with inadequate hypoglycaemic counterregulation may reflect diminished autonomic activity consequent upon reduced responsiveness of a central glucoregulatory centre, rather than classical autonomic neuropathy.

 Thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were evaluated at the proximal anastomosis (w), 5.0 (x), 25.0 (y), and 50.0 (z) cm distal from w, and platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were monitored at sites w and z.
 TxB2 levels increased after blood entered the graft and progressively increased until the blood exited at the distal anastomosis.
 Platelet counts did not significantly change across the graft.
 Over time, systemic platelet counts decreased to approximately 50% of each dog's pregraft baseline levels and remained depressed over a 1 year period.
 Mean platelet volumes peaked 1-3 weeks after implant and remained greater than pregraft levels.
 Examination of the graft luminal surface showed a developed pseudointima characteristically similar to that which develops in mature human vascular grafts.
 These results suggest that healed vascular grafts in canines continue to stimulate platelet release of TxB2, reduce systemic platelet counts, and increase mean platelet volumes over 1 year.
 These data further suggest that platelets are stimulated by the graft and consumed.

"Interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy.
 It has been estimated that 20 million people in the United States have gallstone disease.
 The choice of the optimal management strategy for a patient with symptomatic gallstones in the 1990s will take into account the clinical status of the patient, the characteristics of the gallstones, and the patient's preference.
 Only patients whose doctors understand the advantages and disadvantages of the newer methods can make properly informed choices.
 When interventional radiologic alternatives to cholecystectomy are being contemplated, one approach is to first consider the patient's clinical presentation (acute or nonacute) and then their risk of death after cholecystectomy (low or high).
 Figure 5 shows an algorithmic approach to the management of gallbladder stones based on this concept.
 This algorithm also can be used as a framework for discussion of treatment options with any individual patient.

"The value of push-type jejunal endoscopy in familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome.
 Push-type jejunal endoscopy using a long forward-viewing duodenofiberscope was performed in 10 patients with familial adenomatosis coli/Gardner's syndrome.
 Jejunal polypoid lesions were detected in nine of the 10 patients (90%).
 The lesions appeared sessile, whitish, and measured 3 mm or less in diameter.
 Histologic findings of the biopsy specimens from these polypoid lesions revealed tubular adenoma in all nine patients.
 In addition, this method led to the detection of duodenal adenomas in one patient, in whom duodenofiberscopy with the side-viewing instrument revealed no polypoid lesions in the bulb and second portion of the duodenum.
 In view of these results, we recommend that push-type jejunal endoscopy, as well as side-viewing duodenofiberscopy, should be added to the usual preoperative examinations done in patients with this disease.

"Bidirectional incompatibility between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans 
 Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) describes the phenomenon whereby eggs fertilized by sperm from insects infected with a rickettsial endosymbiont fail to hatch.
 Unidirectional CI between conspecific populations of insects is a well documented phenomenon.
 Bidirectional CI has, however, only been described in mosquito populations, and recently between closely related species of parasitic wasps, where it is of interest as both an unusual form of reproductive isolation and as a potential means of insect population suppression.
 Here we report on the first known example of bidirectional CI between conspecific populations of Drosophila simulans.
 Further, we show that defects as early as the first cleavage division are associated with CI.
 This observation suggests that the cellular basis of CI involves disruption of processes before or during zygote formation and that CI arises from defects in the structure and/or function of the sperm during fertilization.

 A nonrandomized trial was conducted to assess the efficiency and toxicity of bleomycin as a single agent in treatment of non-life-threatening AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
 Sixty patients were enrolled in this study.
 They all had a disseminated and progressive non-life-threatening AIDS-related KS associated with systemic symptoms and/or CD4 lymphocyte count less than 400/mm3.
 Thirty patients were treated with intramuscular bleomycin (5 mg/d for 3 days every 2 or 3 weeks) and 30 others with a slow continuous intravenous infusion of bleomycin (6 mg/m3/d for 4 days every 4 weeks).
 The mean duration of therapy was 5 months (range, 2 to 24 months).
 A partial response was observed in 29 patients (48.3%) and the disease was stabilized in 18 additional patients (30%).
 Bleomycin failed in 21.6% of patients.
 Therapy had to be discontinued in two patients because of side effects.
 Thus bleomycin as a single agent is a good alternative therapy for AIDS-related KS.

 The modified relative-dose-response (MRDR) assay has been validated in rats as a function of vitamin A status and tested in a group of American children.
 In this study the MRDR assay was applied to West Javan children who are at risk of being vitamin A deficient.
 Of 86 children enrolled, 75 were tested.
 In a time-course study involving 22 children aged 3.7-5.3 y, blood samples were taken at different times after doses of 0.35 mumol 3,4-didehydroretinyl acetate/kg body wt.
 Generally, the ratio of dehydroretinol to retinol (DR-R ratio) peaked between 4 and 8 h.
 Thereafter, in a survey of 53 children aged 0.6-4.8 y, single blood samples were drawn 5 h after the dehydroretinyl acetate dose.
 The DR-R ratio ranged from 0.0028 to 0.169.
 With a DR-R ratio of 0.03 as the cutoff value, 62% of the children were judged to be of marginal vitamin A status.

"Transforming growth factor-beta activity in sheep lung lymph during the development of pulmonary hypertension.
 Chronic pulmonary hypertension is associated with extensive structural remodeling of the pulmonary arterial bed.
 The structural changes in the arterial walls include increased production of extracellular matrix components and smooth muscle cell hypertrophy, changes that have been similarly induced by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in culture.
 In the present study, experiments were performed to determine whether TGF-beta is present in sheep lung lymph, and whether TGF-beta levels were altered in an animal model of chronic pulmonary hypertension induced by continuous air embolization.
 Several standard biological assays for TGF-beta activity were used for these determinations including soft agar assays, inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, and a TGF-beta-specific radioreceptor assay.
 In each case, control lung lymph contained high concentrations of TGF-beta (100 ng/ml) which required transient acidification for detection.
 Samples of lung lymph from hypertensive sheep showed a transient and early two- to threefold increase in concentrations of latent TGF-beta.
 This activity could be partially blocked by TGF-beta antibodies.
 These studies indicate that sheep lung lymph contains TGF-beta and that the level of TGF-beta increases early during the development of pulmonary hypertension.
 Thus, TGF-beta may contribute to the development of the structural changes in the pulmonary arteries that occur during the onset of chronic pulmonary hypertension.

"Dynamic CT scanning of pancreatic duct after secretin provocation in pancreas divisum.
 Variations in pancreatic duct diameter at CT scanning and serum pancreatic amylase response following secretin administration were studied in 29 patients with pancreas divisum and unexplained upper abdominal pain.
 Eleven healthy individuals were used as controls.
 At endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) six patients had signs of marked and six moderate pancreatitis, whereas there were no pancreatitis changes in 17 of the patients.
 At CT scanning patients with marked pancreatitis (ERP) had significantly increased pancreatic duct diameter as compared to patients without signs of pancreatitis.
 The duct was visualized in 52% of all patients before and 71% after secretin stimulation the corresponding figures for healthy controls, being 18% both before and after secretin.
 In patients without signs of pancreatitis, it was demonstrated in 5/17 (29%) before and 11/17 (65%) after secretin, whereas it was seen in 10/12 (83%) pancreatitis patients both before and after the hormonal provocation.
 In five of the nonpancreatitis patients in whom the duct was measurable before and at all study intervals (10, 20, and 50 min) after secretin, there was a significant duct dilation response both at 10 min and when comparing the maximal duct diameter after secretin to the initial values.
 In contrast secretin did not affect the duct caliber in pancreatitis patients.
 Serum pancreatic amylase increased significantly after secretin administration to healthy controls and nonpancreatitis patients but was uninfluenced in the marked and moderate pancreatitis groups, respectively.
 However, when all pancreatitis patients were grouped together, the amylase levels were significantly elevated by secretin.
 In conclusion, secretin provocation caused duct dilation at CT scanning in pancreas divisum patients without signs of pancreatitis at ERP.

 Migraine and asthma have been reported to occur in the same person more commonly than would be expected if they are independent.
 The large Collaborative Perinatal Project provided an opportunity to see if children born to women with migraine or with the group of disorders characterized by asthma and/or allergies were more likely to manifest asthma or eczema in the first 7 years of life.
 Among children whose mothers had neither migraine nor asthma/allergies, 3.2% had asthma.
 Of children whose mothers had migraine, but not asthma/allergies, more than 6% had asthma.
 The risk of asthma among children born to women who had both migraine and asthma/allergies was greater than the risk associated with each maternal disease.
 The risk of eczema in children was not appreciably influenced by the mother's propensity to migraine or asthma/allergies.
 The results of this first study of migraine in one generation and asthma in the next lead to the conclusion that the two disorders are probably related.

 Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA) and pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC) are related benign disorders without recognized association with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL).
 We report the cases of two children with documented PLEVA evolving into CTCL over several years.
 One child had the clinical lesions of PLC but the dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA at age 2 years.
 At age 12 years, he had skin changes of poikiloderma atrophicans vasculare and dermatopathologic findings consistent with parapsoriasis en plaque.
 The second child presented at age 7 years with scaling dermatitis and dermatopathologic findings of PLEVA.
 At age 12 years, the histologic diagnosis was parapsoriasis.
 Monoclonal antibody studies performed on biopsy specimens from both patients revealed 70% to 100% cells staining with CD5, 80% to 90% staining with CD4, 30% to 50% staining with CD8, and an increase in CD1-staining cells in the papillary dermis, indicating a predominantly helper T-cell infiltrate.
 We believe that PLC and PLEVA may be part of the spectrum of CTCL.
 Furthermore, CTCL may be more common in young children than once thought.

 The long-term follow-up study (41 +/- 23 months) of 47 patients undergoing direct current ablation because of drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias is reported.
 Significant early complications occurred in four patients and included hypotension, pericarditis, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and one sudden death.
 In 42 patients (86%), complete atrioventricular (AV) block was initially achieved.
 During the follow-up period, AV conduction resumed in 2 of these 42 patients.
 Of the seven patients in whom ablation was unsuccessful, two developed late complete AV block and three had symptomatic improvement.
 An improved activity level was reported among 83% of the patients with successful ablation.
 Health care utilization manifest as the number of hospital admissions per year before and after ablation decreased significantly after ablation (2.4 +/- 2.0 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001).
 Echocardiographic evaluation in five patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (27 +/- 7%) before ablation showed a significant increase (45 +/- 14%, p less than 0.05) after an average follow-up period of 31 months.
 New onset of congestive heart failure occurred after ablation in four patients, of whom two had no structural heart disease.
 The total mortality rate, including the one patient with sudden death, was 17% and was significantly higher among patients with underlying structural heart disease.

"The relationship between respiratory impairment and asbestos-related pleural abnormality in an active work force 
 With the general improvement in environmental controls in workplaces where asbestos is used, an increasing number of workers are seen who exhibit isolated pleural plaques.
 The question as to whether these are associated with respiratory impairment independently of parenchymal disease remains unresolved.
 The question was reinvestigated using quantitative gallium-67 lung scanning to take into account early parenchymal change not evident on the chest radiograph.
 We carried out a cross-sectional study of 110 construction insulators all currently at work.
 Overall, 58.2% had pleural abnormality, 52.5% pleural plaques only, and 5.5% diffuse pleural thickening as assessed from the PA chest radiograph.
 Compared with those without, those with any pleural abnormality had a decrease in FEV1 and FVC on average of 222 and 402 ml (p less than 0.05), and those with isolated pleural plaques, a decrease on average of 200 and 350 ml (p less than 0.05), after taking into account age, height, smoking status, and the presence of parenchymal abnormality as assessed by chest radiography and gallium uptake.
 The complaint of dyspnea with strenuous activities was also significantly related to the width and extent of chest wall pleural thickening (p less than 0.05), independently of parenchymal disease.
 This study suggests that the most common radiographic findings in asbestos-exposed, isolated pleural plaques are associated with a significant reduction in FEV1 and FVC, which cannot be attributed to the presence of radiographic and subradiographic pulmonary fibrosis.

"Parathyroid hormone and the vascular response to norepinephrine.
 Norepinephrine blood pressure reactivity is reduced in uremia, an effect attributed to excess parathyroid hormone (PTH).
 Most, but not all, animal and human studies support the theory that high PTH levels diminish the pressor response to norepinephrine.
 In hemodialysis patients in whom norepinephrine infusion tests were performed to determine the effect of parathyroidectomy on vascular responsiveness, the vascular response to norepinephrine (100 ng/kg/min) improved significantly (11.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg before and 17.5 +/- 2.4 mm Hg after parathyroidectomy; P less than .01).
 Excess parathyroid hormone appears to play an active role in reduced vascular responsiveness to norepinephrine, although the mechanisms of this effect are unknown.

"Noncoordinate regulation of alpha-1 adrenoreceptor coupling and reexpression of alpha skeletal actin in myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure in rats.
 To determine the effects of myocardial infarction-induced left ventricular failure on the regulation of surface alpha-1 adrenoreceptors and signal transduction, large infarcts were produced in rats and the animals killed seven days later.
 After the documentation of impaired left ventricular pump performance, radioligand binding studies of the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor, norepinephrine-stimulated phosphoinositol turnover, and ADP ribosylation of 41 kD substrate by pertussis toxin were examined in the hypertrophying unaffected myocardium.
 Moreover, the expression of sarcomeric actin isoforms was analyzed by Northern blots and hybridization with specific oligonucleotide probes.
 Alpha-1 adrenoreceptor density was found not to be altered in membranes obtained from the spared left ventricular tissue, whereas phosphoinositol turnover was increased 3.1-fold in the viable myocytes of infarcted hearts.
 Furthermore, pertussis toxin substrate was augmented 2.5-fold in membranes prepared from the surviving left ventricular myocardium.
 Finally, an upregulation of the skeletal actin isoform was detected in the tissue of the failing left ventricle.
 In conclusion, the possibility is raised that in the presence of severe myocardial dysfunction and ongoing reactive hypertrophy, effector pathways linked to the alpha-1 adrenoreceptor may stimulate the myocyte hypertrophic response which would tend to normalize cardiac hemodynamics.
 The reexpression of alpha skeletal actin may be a molecular indicator of the persistance of an overload on the myocardium.

 Thirty to fifty percent of patients with reflux esophagitis fail to heal after treatment with conventional doses of H2-receptor antagonists, whereas omeprazole administration induces more than 90% healing.
 To investigate the effect of omeprazole and higher-than-presently-recommended doses of H2-blockers, we evaluated gastric acidity and gastroesophageal reflux in 17 patients with severe-moderate esophagitis before and after treatment with 300 mg ranitidine twice daily or 20 mg omeprazole once daily.
 Three pH-metric studies were performed, in a cross-over design, before and after 8 days of treatment with omeprazole or ranitidine.
 Both drugs significantly reduced intragastric acidity (p less than 0.001) during both night and day hours.
 Median hourly 24-h intragastric pH was 1.8 in the basal study, 2.9 after ranitidine, and 3.4 after omeprazole.

"Relationship between the content of lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-links in skin collagen, nonenzymatic glycosylation, and long-term complications in type I diabetes mellitus.
 Many abnormalities in collagen have been reported in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, some or all of which have been attributed to increased cross-linking.
 Although recent work has focused on the role of glucose-derived collagen cross-links in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications, relatively few studies have investigated the role of lysyl oxidase-dependent (LOX) cross-links.
 In the present study, LOX cross-links and nonenzymatic glycosylation were quantified in skin collagen from diabetic subjects.
 There was an increase in the difunctional cross-link dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) as well as in one of its trifunctional maturation products, hydroxypyridinium.
 All other LOX crosslinks were normal.
 Nonenzymatic glycosylation was increased in diabetic skin collagen, and this increase was correlated with increases in DHLNL (P less than 0.001).
 The biochemical results were examined for correlations with clinical data from the same subjects.
 Increases in DHLNL content were associated with duration of diabetes (P less than 0.003), glycohemoglobin levels (P less than 0.001), hand contractures (P less than 0.05), skin changes (P less than 0.005), and microalbuminuria (P less than 0.01).
 In nondiabetic subjects age was not correlated with collagen cross-link content with the exception that his-HLNL increased with age (r = 0.79, P less than 0.02).
 In diabetic subjects, PA levels decreased with age (r = 0.51, P less than 0.02).
 With increased duration of diabetes, DHLNL content was increased (r = 0.55, P less than 0.003) and OHP was increased (r = 0.59, P less than 0.01), whereas PA levels were decreased (r = -0.48, P less than 0.04).
 Nonenzymatic glycosylation of collagen was also increased with increased duration of diabetes (hex-lys, r = 0.47, P less than 0.02; hex-hyl, r = 0.39, P less than 0.05).
 We conclude that: (a) lysyl oxidase-dependent cross-linking is increased in skin collagen in diabetes and (b) that these changes in skin collagen are correlated with duration of diabetes, glycemic control, and long-term complications.

"Digitalis-like activity in human plasma: relation to blood pressure and sodium balance.
 PURPOSE: On the assumption that renal tubular cells are more important as the target cells for a natriuretic factor than blood cells, we used a well-characterized cultured renal tubular cell line, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), cells to monitor the circulating digitalis-like factor in human plasma and examine its role in the regulation of blood pressure and sodium balance.
 SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of plasma on binding of radioactive ouabain to monolayered MDCK cells in order to determine the level of a circulating digitalis-like factor.
 First, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding to MDCK cells in the presence of plasma from 71 outpatients (34 normotensive subjects and 37 hypertensive patients) after incubation for 4 hours.
 Second, we measured specific 3H-ouabain binding after incubation of cells with plasma from 16 hospitalized subjects (eight normotensive subjects and eight hypertensive patients) receiving low and high sodium diets.
 RESULTS: In Study 1, ouabain binding was lower by 30% with plasma from hypertensive patients than with plasma from normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01).
 There was a significant negative correlation between individual subject's systolic or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.34, p less than 0.01 or r = -0.29, p less than 0.01).
 In Study 2, ouabain binding was also significantly reduced by 25% in the presence of plasma from hypertensive subjects as compared with plasma from normotensive subjects irrespective of sodium intake (p less than 0.01).
 A significant negative correlation was also found for all subjects between either systolic, diastolic, or mean blood pressure and ouabain binding (r = -0.58, p less than 0.01, r = -0.51, p less than 0.01, or r = -0.55, p less than 0.01, respectively).
 With the changes from low to high sodium intake, there was a corresponding decrease in ouabain binding (p less than 0.01) and an increase in sodium excretion (p less than 0.01).
 A significant negative correlation was observed between these two parameters (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that a circulating digitalis-like factor, which may act on renal tubular cells as the ouabain-displacing compound, is increased in patients with essential hypertension and also demonstrate that plasma levels may be influenced by changes in dietary sodium intake.

"Role of visceral afferent mechanisms in functional bowel disorders.
 This report analyzes the clinical and physiological evidence supporting a role for altered visceral afferent mechanisms in the pathogenesis of two functional bowel syndromes: noncardiac chest pain and the irritable bowel syndrome.
 Considerable recent evidence indicates that increased contractility is present only in a minority of patients and that hypercontractile episodes are not temporally related to abdominal pain.
 In contrast, altered sensation and motor reflexes in response to physiological stimuli, such as mechanical distention or acid, is common when appropriately investigated.
 The vagal and spinal afferent innervation mediates visceral sensation and is involved in multiple reflex loops regulating gastrointestinal effector function, such as motility and secretion.
 Sensory input can be modulated peripherally at the afferent nerve terminal, at the level of prevertebral ganglia, the spinal cord, and the brainstem.
 An up-regulation of afferent mechanisms would result both in altered conscious perception of physiological stimuli and in altered motor reflexes.
 Current evidence is consistent with an alteration in the peripheral functioning of visceral afferents and/or in the central processing of afferent information in the etiology of altered somatovisceral sensation and motor function observed in patients with functional bowel disease.

 In this review, 55 patients with intraductal (ID) AC and 17 patients with infiltrating (IF) AC were analyzed retrospectively to define the histologic features and clinical course of this neoplasm.
 Recurrences in the breast occurred in 3 of 20 ID-AC patients treated by biopsy alone, but not in the 2 patients who received local radiation therapy after biopsy.
 One patient with ID-AC had axillary metastases at the time of treatment by mastectomy and died of disease five years later.
 The remaining patients with ID-AC treated by mastectomy have remained disease free.
 One of the three patients with IF-AC treated by biopsy alone died of disease, and one of two patients with IF-AC treated by biopsy and radiotherapy was alive with carcinoma.
 Twelve patients with IF-AC were treated by mastectomy.
 Ten of them were recurrence free at the time of last observation.
 More than one-third of the cases of ID-AC and IF-AC were detected by mammography alone.
 Survival analysis of IF-AC cases compared with nonapocrine duct carcinoma cases matched for stage revealed no statistical difference in estimated recurrence-free survival or estimated survival probability.
 AC is a distinct morphologic entity with a natural history similar to that of nonapocrine ductal carcinoma.

"Predictive value of tumor estrogen and progesterone receptor levels in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer treated with toremifene.
 The predictive value of estrogen receptor (ER) concentrations was evaluated in a group of 113 postmenopausal patients with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER greater than 7 fmol/mg protein) advanced breast cancer.
 In 103 patients, tumors were also sampled for progesterone receptor (PgR) determination.
 All patients were treated with toremifene, a novel antiestrogen, 60 mg daily.
 The median ER in 51 responders was 78 fmol/mg protein, and in 62 nonresponders, 51 fmol/mg protein; the median PgR levels were 40 and 37 fmol/mg protein, respectively.
 The response rate in patients with ER less than 50 fmol/mg protein was 38%, and 51% in the group with ER greater than 50 fmol/mg protein (not significant [NS]).
 The response rate in patients with PgR less than 10 fmol/mg protein was 42%, and in patients with greater than 10 fmol/mg protein, 44%.
 The duration of response in patients with ER greater than 50 fmol/mg protein was significantly longer than with lower ER levels (P = 0.002).
 PgR was not associated with the duration of response.
 In Cox's multiple regression analysis, ER was an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.005) for response duration.
 Thus, the ER concentration of tumor tissue predicts the duration of response but not the response rate to toremifene in patients with advanced breast cancer.
 The PgR status does not predict the response rate or the duration of response.

 The records of 145 paraplegic or quadriplegic patients were reviewed to identify those factors useful in the correct diagnosis of the acute abdomen in this population.
 Twenty-one patients had 22 episodes of acute or subacute abdominal problems.
 Presenting complaints, physical findings, and laboratory results were useful in various ways.
 However appropriate radiographic studies led to the correct diagnosis in 77% of patients.
 Although paraplegic and quadriplegic patients are predisposed to a distinct constellation of medical problems, including urinary tract infection and calculi, they also may present with other abdominal conditions that cause significant morbidity and mortality if not promptly recognized.

"Potential role of the tissue renin-angiotensin system in the pathophysiology of congestive heart failure.
 The circulating renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays an important role in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis.
 It has recently been demonstrated that endogenous RAS exist in target tissues that are important in cardiovascular regulation.
 This article reviews the multiple effects of angiotensin II in target tissues, the evidence for the presence of functional tissue RAS and the data that suggest a role for these tissue RAS in the pathophysiology of heart failure.
 Activation of circulating neurohormones is predictive of worsened survival in heart failure; however, cardiac and renal tissue RAS activities are also increased in the compensated stage of heart failure, when plasma renin-angiotensin activity is normal.
 It is hypothesized that the plasma RAS maintains circulatory homeostasis during acute cardiac decompensation, while changes in tissue RAS contribute to homeostatic responses during chronic sustained cardiac impairment.
 This concept of different functions of circulating and tissue RAS in the pathophysiology of heart failure may have important pharmacologic implications.

 Acute phase proteins were measured in six patients before liver transplantation and for 72 h after orthotopic liver transplantation.
 The ability of the donor liver to mount an acute phase response was demonstrated, although the response was less than that seen in other groups of patients in whom this has been studied.
 Because of the reduced response to stress, the value of these measurements as indicators of liver function in this group of patients is limited.

"High- versus standard-dose megestrol acetate in women with advanced breast cancer: a phase III trial of the Piedmont Oncology Association.
 One hundred seventy-two patients with advanced breast cancer were randomized to receive oral standard-dose megestrol acetate (MA), 160 mg/d or high-dose MA, 800 mg/d.
 All but two patients had one prior trial of tamoxifen therapy for either metastatic disease (74%) or as adjuvant treatment (26%).
 Pretreatment characteristics were similar for both arms.
 High-dose MA resulted in a superior complete plus partial response rate (27% v 10%, P = .005), time to treatment failure (median, 8.0 v 3.2 months, P = .019), and survival (median, 22.4 v 16.5 months, P = .04) when compared with standard-dose therapy.
 These differences remained significant after adjustment for other covariates.
 Thirty-four patients were given high-dose MA after failure of standard-dose MA treatment, and none responded.
 Weight gain was the most distressing side effect, with 13% of standard-dose and 43% of high-dose patients gaining more than 20 lbs.
 Four major cardiovascular events occurred in patients receiving high-dose treatment and one in patients given standard doses.
 Other toxicity was modest.
 High-dose MA may represent a significant improvement in secondary endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer patients refractory to initial endocrine treatment, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until these results are confirmed by other clinical trials.

"Tyrosine kinase and control of cell proliferation.
 The usefulness of phosphotyrosine antibodies for the detection of physiologically regulated or deregulated tyrosine kinases is discussed in this report.
 This rather rare enzymatic activity is shared by receptors for some polypeptide growth factors and by the products of Class 1 oncogenes.
 The antibodies are able to detect proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF.
 The major phosphorylated protein species are the receptors themselves, which undergo phosphorylation only after the addition of the exogenous factor and only transiently.
 Phosphotyrosine antibodies were able to detect the products of the retroviral Class 1 oncogenes, which are endowed with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity.
 In fact, in these cases a constitutive phosphorylation of the relevant proteins was observed, which occurred continuously and independently of the presence or lack of exogenous ligands.
 A tyrosine kinase constitutively activated in human gastric carcinoma cells was detected by P-Tyr antibodies.
 This molecule has been characterized at the molecular level, and the mechanisms responsible for its enzymatic activation have been investigated.
 The question of whether the tyrosine kinase identified is responsible for the induction and the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in gastric carcinomas remains to be answered.
 It is reasonable to suggest that this might be the case by analogy with other situations such as Class 1 oncogenes activated by transduction by retroviruses, abnormal expression of EGF receptors, or deregulated activity of c-abl-encoded proteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
 Thus, the search for deregulated kinases by means of phosphotyrosine antibodies seems to be useful for identifying new activated oncogenes in clinical oncology.

"The importance of context in choosing nutritional indicators.
 Nutritional indicators are used to screen, diagnose, and evaluate interventions in individuals.
 They are also used in populations to ascertain and place under surveillance the magnitude of nutritional problems, their location and causes, and to evaluate the impact of programs and policies.
 Nutritional indicators are also used for research to make inferences about biological and social mechanisms affecting or being affected by nutrition.
 All these activities include measurements of nutritional indicators, but the choice of indicators, their measurements, analyses, and the need for other data can be very different for inferences from research, for patient management, for making public policy, or for planning or evaluating programs.
 There is no best indicator, best measure of an indicator, or best analysis of an indicator in a generic sense.
 The definition of ""best"" depends ultimately on what is most appropriate for the decision that must be made.

"Role of membrane proteins in monosodium urate crystal-membrane interactions. II. Effect of pretreatments of erythrocyte membranes with membrane permeable and impermeable protein crosslinking agents.
 Intact, human erythrocytes were pretreated with membrane permeable, dimethyl adipimidate (DMA) and dimethyl suberimidate (DMS) and membrane impermeable 3,3' dithiobis (sulfosuccinimidylpropionate) (DTSSP) protein crosslinking agents and incubated with monosodium urate monohydrate (MSUM) crystals.
 The percent inhibition of lysis values for pretreated cells relative to untreated cells were determined.
 All 3 agents caused a concentration dependent inhibition of MSUM induced hemolysis that was not due to a decrease in MSUM binding to the pretreated membranes.
 It was proposed that the inhibition of lysis was due to crosslinking of integral and cytoskeletal membrane proteins, resulting in a reduced mobility of the proteins, inhibition of lateralization of integral proteins into aggregates and decreased ""pore"" formation in the membrane.

"Effect of epinephrine and lidocaine therapy on outcome after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.
 One hundred ninety-nine patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest persisted in ventricular fibrillation after the first defibrillation attempt and were then randomly assigned to receive either epinephrine or lidocaine before the next two shocks.
 The resulting electrocardiographic rhythms and outcomes for each group of patients were compared for each group and also compared with results during the prior 2 years, a period when similar patients primarily received sodium bicarbonate as initial adjunctive therapy.
 Asystole occurred after defibrillation with threefold frequency after repeated injection of lidocaine (15 of 59, 25%) compared with patients treated with epinephrine (four of 55, 7%) (p less than 0.02).
 There was no difference in the proportion of patients resuscitated after treatment with either lidocaine or epinephrine (51 of 106, 48% vs.
 50 of 93, 54%) and in the proportion surviving (18, 19% vs.
 21, 20%), respectively.
 Resuscitation (64% vs.
 50%, p less than 0.005) but not survival rates (24% vs.
 20%) were higher during the prior 2-year period in which initial adjunctive drug treatment for persistent ventricular fibrillation primarily consisted of a continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate.
 The negative effect of lidocaine or epinephrine treatment was explained in part by their influence on delaying subsequent defibrillation attempts.
 Survival rates were highest (30%) in a subset of patients who received no drug therapy between shocks.
 We conclude that currently recommended doses of epinephrine and lidocaine are not useful for improving outcome in patients who persist in ventricular fibrillation.

"Treatment of testicular cancer: a new and improved model.
 Testicular cancer has become a model for a curable neoplasm.
 Prior to the advent of cisplatin combination chemotherapy, standard chemotherapy consisted of dactinomycin, alone or in combination with chlorambucil and methotrexate.
 Disseminated germ cell tumors were chemosensitive to these older regimens, with a 50% objective response rate and a 10% to 20% complete remission rate; however, the cure rate was only 5% to 10%.
 In 1974, we began our initial cisplatin plus vinblastine plus bleomycin (PVB) chemotherapy.
 Thirty-three of 47 patients with disseminated germ cell tumors treated from 1974 to 1976 achieved a complete remission (CR), and an additional five (11%) were rendered disease-free with post-PVB resection of teratoma or carcinoma.
 Twenty-seven (57%) of these patients are continuously disease-free with a minimal follow-up of 13 + years.
 Thus, cisplatin-based chemotherapy produced a one-log increase in the cure rate compared with dactinomycin.
 A subsequent phase III study performed from 1976 to 1978 demonstrated that the vinblastine dosage could be reduced 25% from 0.4 mg/kg to 0.3 mg/kg with a reduction in toxicity but without any decrement in therapeutic efficacy.
 A third-generation PVB study from 1978 to 1981 documented that optimal cure rates were achieved with 12 weeks of induction therapy with PVB and that long-term maintenance therapy with vinblastine was unnecessary.
 In 1978, we initiated salvage therapy with cisplatin plus etoposide (VP-16) in patients not cured with PVB, and 25% of these patients were subsequently cured with this regimen.
 This represented the first time an adult solid tumor had been cured with a second-line regimen.
 In 1983, we began studies with third-line therapy with cisplatin plus ifosfamide combination chemotherapy, and even in this refractory setting, approximately 20% of patients are curable.
 From 1981 to 1984, we compared cisplatin plus VP-16 plus bleomycin (PVP16B) with PVB as first-line chemotherapy.
 There was a significant reduction in neuromuscular toxicity favoring the VP-16 arm, and furthermore, 78% of these patients were continuously disease-free compared with 66% with PVB.
 Approximately 75% of patients with disseminated germ cell tumors will be cured with PVP16B, and an additional 10% are curable with salvage chemotherapy.
 This represents the highest cure rate in any adult malignancy.

"Very low birth weight children: behavior problems and school difficulty in a national sample 
 We addressed three questions concerning the behavioral and academic status of low and very low birth weight infants through a secondary analysis of the 1981 National Health Interview Survey--Child Health Supplement: (1) in children born with very low birth weight, what is the risk of behavior problems and school difficulty compared with that in heavier low birth weight and normal birth weight children? (2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34% of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20% and 14% of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index.
 Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems.
 We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior.

"Low allergenicity of clonidine impedes studies of sensitization mechanisms in guinea pig models.
 During clinical trials, a clonidine transdermal device has been found to induce clonidine-specific allergic contact dermatitis in up to 25% of patients during a treatment period of 1 year.
 Using 3 different guinea pig strains, development was attempted of an experimental guinea pig model that would allow for in-depth studies into the mechanism of sensitization, and a possible role of transdermal device components.
 Transient low-level clonidine allergy could be obtained only in a minority of animals, with severe sensitization procedures departing from epicutaneous applications, combined with intradermal (adjuvant) FCA injections.
 Sensitization was not potentiated by additional booster procedures, including cyclophosphamide pretreatment, nor any of the putative cofactors (UV-treatments, C.
 parvum or acetaldehyde involvement) studied.
 These results suggest that the persistent skin contacts in man, with transdermal devices for sustained drug delivery, generate unique conditions favouring the development of allergic contact dermatitis, which are difficult to mimic in experimental animal models.
 Thus, clinical allergy may develop even to extremely weak sensitizing drugs that can be safely used orally, and escape most currently available predictive contact allergy animal models.
 Clinical studies remain unavoidable for studying factors that may reduce sensitization rates to more acceptable levels.

"Fertility after contraception or abortion.
 There is a very small correlation, if any, between the prior use of OCs and congenital malformations, including Down's syndrome.
 There are few, if any, recent reports on masculinization of a female fetus born to a mother who took an OC containing 1 mg of a progestogen during early pregnancy.
 However, patients suspected of being pregnant and who are desirous of continuing that pregnancy should not continue to take OCs, nor should progestogen withdrawal pregnancy tests be used.
 Concern still exists regarding the occurrence of congenital abnormalities in babies born to such women.
 The incidence of postoperative infection after first trimester therapeutic abortion in this country is low.
 However, increasing numbers of women are undergoing repeated pregnancy terminations, and their risk for subsequent pelvic infections may be multiplied with each succeeding abortion.
 The incidence of prematurity due to cervical incompetence or surgical infertility after first trimester pregnancy terminations is not increased significantly.
 Asherman's syndrome may occur after septic therapeutic abortion.
 The pregnancy rate after treatment of this syndrome is low.
 The return of menses and the achievement of a pregnancy may be slightly delayed after OCs are discontinued, but the fertility rate is within the normal range by 1 year.
 The incidence of postpill amenorrhea of greater than 6 months' duration is probably less than 1%.
 The occurrence of the syndrome does not seem to be related to length of use or type of pill.
 Patients with prior normal menses as well as those with menstrual abnormalities before use of OCs may develop this syndrome.
 Patients with normal estrogen and gonadotropin levels usually respond with return of menses and ovulation when treated with clomiphene.
 The rate for achievement of pregnancy is much lower than that for patients with spontaneous return of menses.
 The criteria for defining PID or for categorizing its severity are diverse.
 The incidence of PID is higher among IUD users than among patients taking OCs or using a barrier method.
 The excess risk of PID among IUD users, with the exception of the first few months after insertion, is related to sexually transmitted diseases and not the IUD.
 Women with no risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases have little increased risk of PID or infertility associated with IUD use.
 There appears to be no increased risk of congenital anomalies, altered sex ratio, or early pregnancy loss among spermicide users.
 All present methods of contraception entail some risk to the patient.
 The risk of imparied future fertility with the use of any method appears to be low.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

"Selective intestinal decontamination increases serum and ascitic fluid C3 levels in cirrhosis.
 Selective intestinal decontamination for 7 days with norfloxacin was performed in 14 cirrhotic patients with ascites and low ascitic fluid total protein.
 Variations in serum and ascitic fluid of C3 and C4 and ascitic fluid total protein after therapy were compared with those of a control group of 14 untreated patients with similar characteristics.
 After oral norfloxacin administration, we saw a significant increase of C3 in serum (p less than 0.05) and ascitic fluid (p = 0.01).

 There were no changes in serum C3, ascitic fluid C3, ascitic fluid C4 or in ascitic fluid total protein in group 2.
 These data demonstrate that selective intestinal decontamination increases serum and ascitic fluid C3 levels and, therefore, might be useful in preventing spontaneous infections in cirrhotic patients at high risk of infection.

"Effects of metoprolol on rest and exercise cardiac function and plasma catecholamines in chronic congestive heart failure secondary to ischemic or idiopathic cardiomyopathy.
 To define the effects of 2 months of metoprolol therapy on cardiac function, aerobic performance and sympathetic nervous system activity, metoprolol (75 to 100 mg/day) was administered to 10 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF).
 Metoprolol was discontinued in 2 patients because of worsening CHF.
 In the remaining 8 patients, peak oxygen uptake increased significantly (14.8 +/- 3.0 to 16.1 +/- 2.5 ml/kg/min, p less than 0.05) as did the oxygen pulse (9.0 +/- 2.2 to 12.6 +/- 1.8 ml/beat, p less than 0.02).
 Resting heart rate (87 +/- 18 to 62 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and peak exercise heart rate (133 +/- 13 to 105 +/- 30 beats/min, p less than 0.02) were both reduced.
 Mean resting ejection fraction increased from 0.15 +/- 0.06 to 0.25 +/- 0.11 and peak exercise ejection fraction also tended to increase (0.19 +/- 0.11 to 0.28 +/- 0.15, difference not significant).

 Circulating lymphocyte beta-adrenergic receptor number was unchanged (1,334 +/- 292 to 1,344 +/- 456 receptors/cell, difference not significant).
 It is concluded that metoprolol therapy is associated with improvements in rest and exercise ventricular performance and maximal aerobic capacity.
 These improvements are associated with a decline in resting sympathetic nervous system activity.

"LVAS pump performance following initiation of left ventricular assistance.
 Prevention of disturbed flow (e.g., flow stasis) and consequent thrombosis in heart pumps is based upon design characteristics determined during laboratory bench tests.
 These tests employ optimal filling and emptying characteristics, such as the full-fill to complete empty mode in the Novacor left ventricular assist system.
 Filling characteristics of the Novacor LVAS were examined during the first 48 hours after implantation in 14 patients.
 Fill volume of the pump was reduced in pathologic states, such as cardiac tamponade, and following the initiation of right ventricular mechanical circulatory support.
 In addition, multiple regression analysis revealed that right ventricular function measured by the amount of inotropic support required, the right ventricular ejection fraction, and the total pulmonary resistance, significantly predicted left ventricular assist pump fill volume during the first 48 hours of support.
 Flow visualization simulating these clinical conditions of incomplete filling suggest inadequate valve washing, particularly around the inlet valve and its conduit, which may predispose to thrombus formation.

"The nuclear pacemaker: is renewed interest warranted?
 From 1973 through 1987, 155 radioisotope-powered ""nuclear"" pacemakers were implanted in 132 patients at the Newark Beth Israel Medical Center.
 The longevity of the first 15 devices, all of which were fixed-rate (VOO) pacemakers, was significantly better than that of 15 lithium-chemistry demand (VVI) pacemakers used as control devices (p = 0.0002).
 Of the entire cohort of 155 nuclear pacemakers, 136 were VVI devices and 19 were VOO units.
 The patients with VOO pacemakers needed reoperations more often than did those with VVI pacemakers, chiefly for mode change (p less than 0.001).
 Power-source failure was observed in only 1 case, but 47 nuclear pacemakers were removed for other reasons, including component malfunction (15 units), mode change (12 units), high pacing thresholds (8 units) and lead or connector problems (5 units).
 The actuarial survival at 15 years was 99% for power sources and 82% for the entire pacing systems (pulse generators plus leads).
 The frequency of malignancy was similar to that of the population at large and primary tumor sites were randomly distributed.
 Deaths most commonly were due to cardiac causes (68%).
 Thus, nuclear pacemakers are safe and reliable and their greater initial cost appears to be offset by their longevity and the resulting decrease in the frequency of reoperations.
 It is reasonable to suggest that further use be made of long-lasting nuclear power sources for modern pacemakers and other implantable rhythm-management devices.

 Population characteristics and technical and methodologic factors were analyzed.
 Sensitivity and specificity for predicting serious coronary disease compare quite well with those from the literature on the exercise ECG and the exercise thallium scintigram.
 Sensitivity increases and specificity decreases more significantly with patient age, and sensitivity is paradoxically lower in laboratories testing patients with more severe disease, as well as when 70% rather than 50% diameter narrowing is used to define angiographic disease.

"Splenic septic emboli in endocarditis.
 The significance of septic emboli to the spleen is inferred by the frequency of septic emboli in general seen in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis who are referred for valve replacement.
 To determine the proper management of splenic infarcts and abscess due to septic emboli, we retrospectively reviewed the records of 108 patients with left-sided endocarditis who underwent valvular surgery at the University of Illinois Hospital from 1980 through 1988.
 Intravenous drug abuse was the etiology in 68% (n = 73).
 The incidence of splenic infarcts and abscess was 19% (n = 20), but an incidental finding of splenic infarcts was found in 38% (n = 11) of 29 asymptomatic patients who had computed tomograms.
 Streptococci and staphylococci were the causative organisms in 85% (n = 17).
 Localized findings were absent in 90% of splenic infarcts and abscesses.
 Abdominal computed tomograms were diagnostic of the sequelae of splenic septic emboli in 100%.
 No patient had intra-abdominal bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Splenectomy was performed in 50% (n = 10) of patients 3-24 days (mean, 11.2 days) after valve replacement.
 Indications for splenectomy included persistent sepsis in 60% (n = 6), large (greater than 2 cm) and peripheral lesions in 30% (n = 3), and splenic rupture in 10% (n = 1).
 Perioperative mortality of patients who underwent splenectomy was 30% (n = 3).
 The following conclusions can be drawn: 1) Splenic septic embolus is common in endocarditis.
 2) Abdominal computed tomography should be performed for all patients.

 This article describes the validity and utility of screening tests for total cholesterol levels in school-age children to predict those who, when adults, will have cholesterol levels that the National Cholesterol Education Program suggests need continuing surveillance and intervention.
 Two thousand three hundred sixty-seven children aged 8 to 18 years were examined on several occasions and were followed up to ages 20 to 30 years.
 Of children with cholesterol concentrations exceeding the 75th percentile on two occasions, 75% of girls and 56% of boys would not qualify for intervention as adults by the National Cholesterol Education Program criteria.
 Of children with cholesterol levels exceeding the 90th percentile on two occasions, 57% of girls and 30% of boys would not qualify for intervention as adults.
 Because the efficacy, safety, acceptability, and cost of treatment for high cholesterol concentrations in childhood is evolving, the need for universal screening of childhood cholesterol levels must be considered carefully in view of the number of children with high levels of cholesterol who, as adults, do not meet the criteria for intervention suggested by the National Cholesterol Education Program.

"Effect of the topical anesthetic EMLA on the efficacy of pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains.
 EMLA cream (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics) is a new topical anesthetic composed of 25 mg lidocaine and 25 mg prilocaine in an oil-in-water emulsion cream.
 It has been found to be very effective for local anesthesia prior to venepuncture, minor surgical procedures, and pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy for port-wine stains (PWS) in children.
 However, since EMLA may cause vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels, we tried to determine whether pretreatment with EMLA decreases the efficacy of subsequent PDL treatment.
 We report eight patients between the ages of 4 and 32 years with PWS who received two test site treatments prior to PDL treatment.
 One site was pretreated with EMLA cream under occlusion for 60 minutes and then left unoccluded for 15 minutes prior to PDL test treatment.
 The other site, in the same area of the PWS and patient's body, was not pretreated with EMLA.
 The test sites were compared 6-8 weeks later to determine whether EMLA decreased the degree of lightening of the PWS compared to the non-EMLA-treated site.
 We conclude that EMLA is an effective topical anesthetic for PDL treatment of PWS and does not adversely affect the efficacy of the treatment.

"Continuous suprascapular nerve block for analgesia of scapular fracture.
 Fracture of the scapular is uncommon but painful.
 A case is described in which a comminuted scapular fracture was treated with a continuous suprascapular nerve block.
 With the patient lying supine an epidural needle was directed towards the scapular notch via a superior approach and an epidural catheter was placed when the notch was believed to have been identified.
 Repeat injections of 10 ml bupivacaine 0.25 per cent with 1/200,000 epinephrine provided analgesia within minutes and a duration of 8-10 hr.
 Injection of 10 ml radio-opaque dye demonstrated the catheter to be lateral to the scapular notch.
 However, dye dispersed throughout the supraspinous fossa including the scapular notch thus blocking the suprascapular nerve.
 This case demonstrates that continuous suprascapular nerve block can be performed for five days and that location of the scapular notch is less important than previously thought.

"Diclofenac-associated hepatotoxicity 
 Diclofenac sodium, a phenylacetic acid-derived nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) recently released in the United States, was associated with the development of significant hepatitis in seven patients, with one associated death.
 Signs and symptoms developed within several weeks of initiation of drug use and generally resolved 4 to 6 weeks following discontinuation of use of the drug.
 The only patient rechallenged with the drug developed a recurrence of her hepatic abnormalities.
 In one patient, fatal, fulminant hepatitis developed despite early withdrawal of the drug.
 Review of the European literature disclosed three additional fatalities associated with diclofenac therapy.
 It is unclear whether the incidence of hepatotoxicity is higher with this drug compared with other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
 Careful patient monitoring is advised, and prompt discontinuation of the drug is suggested when signs or symptoms of liver disease develop.

"Asian osteomalacia is determined by dietary factors when exposure to ultraviolet radiation is restricted: a risk factor model 
 Twenty-seven previously osteomalacic and 77 normal Asian women participated in a seven-day survey of dietary intake and daylight outdoor exposure.
 Individual levels of daylight outdoor exposure discriminated poorly between normal and osteomalacic women.
 The presence of osteomalacia was strongly related to varying degrees of vegetarianism.
 Lactovegetarianism (no meat, fish or egg consumption) was associated with significantly greater osteomalacic risk than ovolactovegetarianism (no meat or fish consumption).
 Unlike Asian rickets, high-extraction wheat cereal as chapatti was not a significant risk factor for osteomalacia in Asian women and dietary fibre was a less important risk factor than absent dietary meat, fish or egg.
 When exposure to ultraviolet radiation is limited, Asian osteomalacia (and Asian rickets) are determined by dietary factors.

"Recognition of a B cell lymphoma by anti-idiotypic T cells.
 Idiotypic IgM derived from a B cell lymphoma can act as a tumor-associated Ag, in that immunization with this purified protein generates an anti-idiotypic immune response that specifically suppresses tumor development.
 Spleens of immune mice contain T cells that proliferate in response to idiotypic IgM.
 However, idiotypic Ag is presented to the T cells most efficiently in its natural form at the surface of the lymphoma cells, than as soluble IgM plus presenting cells.
 Variant tumors that display either little or no idiotypic IgM at the cell surface, but which are otherwise indistinguishable from parental tumor, induce a weak response or fail to stimulate the T cells, respectively.
 Anti-idiotypic lines and clones have been derived from the splenic T cells by growth in the presence of irradiated tumor cells.
 Phenotypic analysis revealed that cells from both lines and clones express CD3 and CD4 Ag, but not CD8.
 Recognition of tumor Id, which required no added presenting cells, was inhibited by antibody against MHC class II Ag, and variably by anti-CD4.
 Proliferative responses were inhibited by anti-idiotypic antibodies, but also by antibodies against the constant region of the mu H chain, indicating that perturbation of the surface IgM abrogates availability of idiotypic determinants to the T cells.

"Current status of duplex Doppler ultrasound in the examination of the abdominal vasculature.
 Duplex Doppler ultrasound has come to play a central role in the diagnosis of a broad spectrum of vascular diseases such as carotid artery occlusive disease and deep vein thrombosis.
 The role of duplex Doppler in the evaluation of intra-abdominal vascular disease remains unclear.
 This article summarizes the current status of duplex scanning in the investigation of the mesenteric arteries, the renal arteries, and the portal venous system.
 The examination is technically demanding, operator-dependent, time-consuming, and frequently unsatisfactory due to bowel gas, obesity, complex anatomy, or postoperative alterations in the normal anatomic patterns.
 Its advantages reside primarily in the absence of toxicity and in the generation of physiologic as well as anatomic information.
 In centers with the proper instrumentation and a skilled technician, duplex examination can be useful in the diagnosis and management of abdominal vascular disease and avoids the inherent dangers of contrast angiography.

"Intercellular propagation of individually programmed growth bursts in FRTL-5 cells. Implications for interpreting growth factor actions.
 Five methods are commonly used to quantify FRTL-5 cells' and other thyrocytes' growth in vitro and the impact of growth inhibiting or stimulating maneuvers: Total cell count, mitotic index, DNA measurement, total [3H]thymidine incorporation, and the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells.
 All of them assess cell growth as though all cells were homogeneous with an identical response to growth factors.
 We demonstrate here that this assumption is not valid.
 Rather, some intrinsically growth-prone cells appear to pass a growth signal to neighboring cells so that variably sized colonies of synchronized cells within each cluster growing from monodispersed cells are formed.
 This is true for FRTL-5 cells growing in vitro in monolayers and in three-dimensional, collagen embedded spheroids.
 The pattern is the same when cell suspensions or collagen-embedded spheroids are implanted onto nude mice.
 Patches with alternating high and low growth become particularly prominent in the large tumor-like organoids grown from monodispersed cells in nude mice.
 The pattern much reminds of similar observations in growing intact thyroids.
 Since there is no significant correlation between the fraction of [3H]thymidine labeled cells and the size of two- or three-dimensional clusters in any experiment, growth of signal-spreading cells is assumed to occur in leaps and bounds.
 Growth velocity in each subclone of a cell population depends on the mean interval between bursts of replications and on the number of cells synchronized by cell-to-cell diffusion of the growth signal emanating from one dividing cell.
 Thus, growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting factors may not only act on the mean interval between successive growth bursts, but they may also change cell-to-cell spreading of growth signals.

"1990 Volvo Award in experimental studies. Anulus tears and intervertebral disc degeneration. An experimental study using an animal model.
 An animal model was developed to test the hypothesis that discrete peripheral tears within the anulus lead to secondary degenerative changes in other disc components.
 In 21 adult sheep, a cut was made in the left anterolateral anulus of three randomly selected lumbar discs.
 The cut was parallel and adjacent to the inferior end-plate, and had a controlled depth of 5 mm.
 This left the inner third of the anulus and the nucleus pulposus intact and closely reproduced the rim Lear lesion described by Schmorl.
 Animals were randomly allocated to different groups in relation to the length of time interval between operation and death, varying from 1 to 18 months.
 At death, the lumbar spine was cut into individual joint units and each disc sectioned into six parasagittal slabs.
 After observation of the slabs under the dissecting microscope, two of the six slabs, the one containing the anulus lesion and a contralateral, were processed for histology.
 The results of this study suggest that, despite the great care taken at operation to ensure that the inner anulus was left intact, progressive failure of the inner anulus was seen in all sheep and occurred in the majority of discs between 4 and 12 months after the operation.
 Although the outermost anulus showed the ability to heal, the defect induced by the cut led initially to deformation and bulging of the collagen bundles, and eventually to inner extension of the tear and complete failure.
 These findings suggest that discrete tears of the outer anulus may have a role in the formation of concentric clefts and in accelerating the development of radiating clefts.
 Peripheral tears of the anulus fibrosus therefore may play an important role in the degeneration of the intervertebral joint complex.

"Evolution of deep venous thrombosis: a prospective evaluation with US.
 Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) established by means of duplex ultrasound (US) were prospectively followed up with serial duplex US examinations during a 6-month period to assess the persistence of venous abnormalities.
 All patients were asymptomatic.
 Isolated popliteal DVT was found to be more likely to revert to normal at duplex compression US than thrombosis involving both the femoral and popliteal systems (P less than .05).
 Increased venous diameter was a sign of acute clot (P less than .005).
 Clot echogenicity did not help to enable distinction of acute DVT and chronic DVT.
 At compression US, 10 of 21 patients (48%) who initially had occlusive thrombosis had persistent abnormalities that mimicked findings consistent with acute DVT.
 Chronic venous changes that persisted after 6 months consisted of either lumen recanalization (with resultant intimal thickening) or persistent venous occlusion.
 Both of these conditions can result in incomplete compression, the major US indication of acute DVT.
 This appearance should not be confused with that of acute DVT.
 Follow-up examinations to establish a baseline appearance can be obtained as early as 6 months after an acute episode of DVT.

"Effective intraperitoneal antiprotease therapy for taurocholate-induced pancreatitis in rats 
 In canine pancreatitis, irreversible hypotension and death follow saturation of the antiprotease molecules in peritoneal exudate by activated proteolytic enzymes which are released from the pancreas.
 This study has examined, in rats with taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, the efficacy of removal of the peritoneal exudate by aspiration and a single lavage, followed by instillation of an exogenous antiprotease solution.
 Instillation of human fresh frozen plasma, containing alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-antiprotease, was associated with the longest median survival.
 Aprotinin, although possessing a much greater trypsin inhibitory capacity, just failed to significantly improve the median survival time compared with the control group.
 Intraperitoneal antiprotease therapy is simple to perform, has a beneficial effect on survival time in this model and merits investigation in man.

 The presence of mitogen(s) in leiomyoma extracts stimulating cells with the fibroblast, myoblast, and osteoblast phenotype was documented.
 Mitogenic activity in leiomyoma extracts was acid stable and sensitive to tryptic digestion.
 Reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography successfully separated mitogen(s) with preferential activity for myoblast cells from mitogens with a broad type of cell specificity and from inhibitors.
 This leiomyoma-derived preferential activity for myoblasts was absent in identically treated myometrial and endometrial extracts.
 This suggests that leiomyoma-derived substances with preferential growth factor activity for myoblast-like cells may play a role in the pathophysiologic characteristics of uterine leiomyomas.

"The effect of established and gestational diabetes on pregnancy outcome.
 OBJECTIVE--To study the prevalence and type of glucose intolerance in pregnancy and the effect of different types on perinatal mortality and fetal size.
 DESIGN--A prospective case-control study with data collected by patient interview and examination of all available records during a 16-months period between 1984 and 1986.
 SETTING--A large maternity hospital in Kuwait where diabetes in pregnancy is common.
 SUBJECTS--The cases were a consecutive sample of 731 women, delivered during the study period, recorded in the labour ward register as being diabetic or having abnormal glucose tolerance, the control group was formed from the next woman in the register (provided she was not known to be diabetic).
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Type of diabetes followed the WHO classification, with subdivision depending on level of fasting plasma glucose.
 Type of perinatal death was examined in detail and birthweight centile calculated.
 RESULTS--Of the 731 cases, 22% were established diabetics, most were treated with oral hypoglycaemic drugs before pregnancy and insulin during pregnancy.
 Of those discovered during pregnancy, 43% were classified as gestational diabetes and the remainder as impaired glucose tolerance.
 Overall, 50% of cases were treated with insulin.
 Established diabetics had a perinatal mortality rate nearly four times greater than non diabetics (RR, 3.7, 95% CI 2.6 to 6.4) and for gestational diabetics RR was 2.0 95% CI 1.2 to 3.7).
 Unexplained deaths were particularly common, both in established diabetics (RR, 18.4, 95% CI 3.9 to 85.7) and in gestational diabetics (RR, 13.4, 95% (CI 2.9 to 61.6).
 Cases with impaired glucose tolerance had no stillbirths and had a lower perinatal loss than the controls, though this was not statistically significant.
 Heavier babies were seen in all case groups compared with controls, though the impaired glucose tolerance group had lower birthweights than the other two case groups.
 CONCLUSIONS--Type 2 diabetes was found to be common, most cases being diagnosed in pregnancy.
 Under the conditions found in Kuwait, diabetes, in the sense of a raised fasting glucose, is accompanied by a high rate of perinatal loss from unexplained stillbirth.
 This applies whether the condition was present before pregnancy or was discovered during pregnancy.
 Fetal macrosomia was also common in both situations.
 Impaired glucose tolerance, where fasting levels remain normal, does not appear to increase fetal loss, but may be associated with fetal macrosomia.
 As these women age they are likely to develop overt diabetes in the non-pregnant state, and subsequently to develop serious complications of this disease.

"The relative risks of caesarean section (intrapartum and elective) and vaginal delivery: a detailed analysis to exclude the effects of medical disorders and other acute pre-existing physiological disturbances.
 OBJECTIVE--To compare maternal mortalities attributable to vaginal delivery, elective caesarean section (CS) and intrapartum CS.
 DESIGN--The number of deaths associated with each method of delivery was ascertained among unselected and among low-risk women by detailed retrospective review of the case-notes of women who died after delivery.
 The frequency of each method of delivery throughout the study period was ascertained from the computer database and enhanced by analysis of the case-notes of unselected groups of women.
 SETTING--The Peninsula Maternity Services (Cape Town) during the years 1975-1986 inclusive.
 SUBJECTS--A total of 108 maternal deaths arising from 263,075 maternities provided accurate information.
 The relative frequency of vaginal and abdominal delivery was determined from the computer database.
 The ratio of elective CS to emergency prepartum CS to intrapartum CS was obtained by review of the first 200 operations in the years 1975, 1977, 1979, 1982 and 1984.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--(i) Mortality rates associated with the different methods of delivery in unselected women and in women who were healthy before surgery; (ii) mortality rates apparently attributable to the method of delivery.
 RESULTS--The overall relative risk of mortality associated with caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery was 7 decreasing to 5 after the exclusion of women with medical or life-threatening antenatal complications (eg, haemorrhage, hypertension).
 The relative risk associated with intrapartum compared with elective sections was 2.3 decreasing to 1.4 after the exclusion of women with medical disorders or life-threatening complications.
 The relative risk of maternal mortality which was apparently attributable to intrapartum compared with elective sections was 1.7.
 However, the 95% confidence intervals of these values, even from this large data-set, are wide.
 Nevertheless, these rates are in broad agreement with an approximation derived from the British confidential enquiries into maternal deaths.
 CONCLUSION--The attributable relative mortalities of caesarean section compared with vaginal delivery and intrapartum compared with elective caesarean section are lower than the overall relative mortalities of these modes of delivery and are approximately 5:1 and 1.5:1 respectively.
 These data are crucially important in the decision to recommend elective caesarean section compared with trial of labour.

"Endogenous vasopressin supports blood pressure and prevents severe hypotension during epidural anesthesia in conscious dogs.
 To evaluate whether, and to what extent, release of endogenous vasopressin supports blood pressure when efferent sympathetic drive is blocked by epidural anesthesia, the authors studied the effects of high epidural anesthesia alone and when vasopressin was prevented from acting at its vascular (V1)-receptor in six awake, trained, unsedated dogs.
 On different days, the same dose of 0.5% bupivacaine (8-13 ml) was injected epidurally in a randomized fashion either in the presence or absence of (V1)-vasopressin receptor blockade, and the effects were evaluated on cardiovascular (arterial blood pressure, heart rate) and respiratory (blood gases, oxygen consumption) variables, and on plasma concentrations of vasopressin and renin.
 Results were also contrasted to those obtained after epidural injection of saline alone (placebo) in the same dogs.
 When endogenous vasopressin was prevented from acting by intravenous pretreatment with a specific V1-receptor antagonist (beta-mercapto-beta, beta-cyclopenta-methylene-propionyl-O-Me-Tyr-Arg-Vasopressin), epidural anesthesia resulted in a rapid and sustained 35% decrease in mean arterial blood pressure from 92 mmHg +/- 5 SE to 60 mmHg +/- 4.
 In contrast, only a 14% decrease in mean blood pressure from 92 mmHg +/- 5 to 79 mm Hg +/- 6 was noted after epidural anesthesia alone.
 This difference between groups was statistically significant (P = 0.0001).
 The V1-receptor blockade alone had no detectable effect.
 Vasopressin plasma concentrations significantly increased from 3.4 +/- 0.3 pg.ml-1 to 16.2 +/- 3.2 pg.ml-1 after epidural anesthesia but did not change after epidural saline.

 Experiments were carried out to detect and establish the origin of Doppler and echo signal enhancement in small vessels of the systemic circulation and of tumors after intravenous injection of a contrast agent.
 Eight woodchucks (Marmota monax) were studied; each woodchuck had naturally occurring hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Injections of 0.1-4.0 mL of air-filled human serum albumin microspheres were administered into a hind limb or jugular vein.
 Ultrasound (US) examination included transabdominal duplex scanning, color Doppler imaging, placement of a Doppler transducer on the exposed tumor, and surgical implantation of pulsed Doppler cuffs.
 Doppler signals were assessed by recording color Doppler images and results of spectral analysis.
 While subjective echo level was unaffected within the tumors, dramatic Doppler signal enhancement was recorded in both normal and tumor vessels.
 At optimum dose levels, a signal gain of approximately 10 dB was recorded from the tumor.
 Analysis showed that the echo enhancement was due to the presence of the contrast agent in branches of the hepatic artery.
 These results suggest that tumor detection may be enhanced by intravenous administration of a US contrast agent.

 Because reduced high density lipoproteins may contribute to atherothrombotic brain infarction, we performed molecular biologic and metabolic studies to characterize high density lipoprotein metabolism with respect to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, to clone the high density lipoprotein receptor, and to determine gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein of high density lipoprotein, because altered structure may impair reverse cholesterol transport.
 For high density lipoprotein metabolism measurements, high density lipoprotein 3 was isolated, purified, and labeled with iodine-125.
 The radiolabeled high density lipoprotein 3 was reinjected, and daily blood samples were taken for 10 days.
 Synthesis rates and fractional catabolic rates were determined from the specific activities and daily decrements.
 Preliminary data indicate that stroke-prone individuals' fractional catabolic rates for high density lipoprotein 3 are twice those of normal individuals.
 Also, the conversion of high density lipoprotein 3 to high density lipoprotein 2 is reduced in these individuals, suggesting that high density lipoprotein may be abnormally processed in individuals prone to atherothrombic brain infarctions.
 We surveyed more than 100 patients with carotid stenosis using a 2.2-kb probe for the apolipoprotein A-I gene.
 A subset of these patients displays polymorphism with restriction enzymes SacI or PstI.

 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exercise on the rate of onset of hypoglycemia induced by infusion of excess insulin (0.8 mU.min-1.100 g-1).

 FD rats showed a significant difference due to exercise only after 40 min (rest 4.2 +/- 0.3 mM, exercise 3.2 +/- 0.2 mM).
 A significant postexercise repletion of glycogen was observed in red vastus and soleus muscles of FD rats despite the decreasing blood glucose values.
 These data indicate that exercise accelerates the rate of development of hypoglycemia in FD rats.
 In the FS rats, where the rate of decline in blood glucose was greater, exercise had no effect on the time course of development of hypoglycemia.

"Fetal and maternal response to intravenous infusion of a thromboxane synthetase inhibitor.
 Pharmacologic inhibition of thromboxane synthetase activity has reversed the clinical manifestations of toxemia in the ovine model.
 To investigate placental transfer and fetal effects of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, CGS13080 (Ciba-Geigy, Summit, N.J.) was intravenously infused into eight singleton- or twin-bearing ewes near term.
 During CGS 13080 infusion (0.1 mg/kg/hr), maternal steady-state CGS 13080 levels of 102 +/- 18 ng/ml were achieved within 30 minutes and maternal serum thromboxane generation decreased significantly (13 +/- 3 to 4 +/- 1 ng/ml).
 However, fetal serum levels of CGS 13080 were only 4% of peak maternal concentrations and fetal serum thromboxane generation did not change.
 There was no evidence of change in uterine blood flow, maternal or fetal blood pressure, heart rate, blood gas values, or fetal or maternal metabolites of prostacyclin or prostaglandin E2 during the study.
 We speculate that CGS 13080 may be efficacious in the treatment of human pregnancy-induced hypertension.

"Decollateralization with silicone rubber sheeting for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a preliminary report.
 A new treatment method, interception of collaterals with a silicone rubber sheet, was applied to three patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in whom arterial chemoembolization was assessed as ineffective because of the developed collateral feeding arteries.
 This procedure was followed by arterial chemoembolization or intraportal infusion chemotherapy or both.
 Follow-up celiac angiography confirmed that the long-term decollateralization was achieved by shielding the liver with silicone rubber sheeting.
 This technique resulted in partial responses without serious complications in all the patients including two who had no responses to chemoembolization before the procedure.
 The response durations were 5, 21, and 27, months, respectively.
 One patient died of gastrointestinal bleeding 7 months after the decollateralization.
 The other two patients are still alive, and the survivals after the procedure are 28 and 30 months, respectively.
 This therapy is considered promising and may be worth choosing as an adjuvant treatment for advanced hepatic malignancies uncontrolled by arterial chemotherapy or chemoembolization.

"Clinical prediction rule for pulmonary infiltrates 
 OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a clinical rule for predicting pneumonic infiltrates in adult patients with acute respiratory illness.
 DESIGN: Prevalence studies in three settings.
 SETTING: Emergency departments of the University of Illinois Hospital at Chicago, the University of Nebraska Medical Center at Omaha, and the Medical College of Virginia at Richmond.
 PATIENTS: Symptoms, signs, comorbidity data, and chest roentgenogram results were recorded for 1134 patients from Illinois (the derivation set), 150 patients from Nebraska, and 152 patients from Virginia (the validation sets).
 All patients presented to the emergency department and had a chest roentgenogram to evaluate fever or respiratory complaints.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Within the training set, temperature greater than 37.8 degrees C, pulse greater than 100 beats/min, rales, decreased breath sounds, and the absence of asthma were identified as significant predictors of radiographically proved pneumonia in a stepwise logistic regression model (P = 0.001).
 The logistic rule discriminated patients with and without pneumonia in the training set with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of 0.82.
 In the validation sets, the rule discriminated pneumonia and nonpneumonia with ROC areas of 0.82 and 0.76 after adjusting for differences in disease prevalence (P greater than 0.2 compared with the training set).
 The predicted probability of having pneumonia for patients with different clinical findings corresponded closely with the incidence of pneumonia among patients with such findings in the three settings.
 CONCLUSIONS: Among adults presenting with acute respiratory illness, a prediction rule based on clinical findings accurately discriminated patients with and without radiographic pneumonia, and was used in two other samples of patients without significant decrement in discriminatory ability.
 This rule can be used by physicians to develop more effective strategies for detecting pneumonia and for helping to determine the need for radiologic study among patients with acute respiratory disease.

"Diagnostic value of a new myocardial perfusion agent, teboroxime (SO 30,217), utilizing a rapid planar imaging protocol: preliminary results [corrected and republished with original paging, article originally printed in J Am Coll Cardiol 1990 Oct;16(4):855-61]
 Technetium-99m-labeled agents have advantages over thallium-201 in terms of photon statistics, cost and clinical availability.
 They have been suggested as an alternative to thallium for myocardial perfusion imaging.
 Teboroxime is a new boronic acid adduct of technetium dioxime (BATO) compound that demonstrates favorable characteristics in preliminary studies.
 With use of a novel (seated) patient positioning technique and a rapid dynamic acquisition protocol, 30 patients underwent planar imaging with teboroxoime while at rest and after maximal treadmill exercise.
 Postexercise scans were completed in an average time (mean +/- SD) of 4.4 +/- 1.6 min, with 4.8 +/- 1.5 min for the views at rest.
 These results were compared with coronary arteriography or thallium scintigraphy after treadmill exercise, or both.
 Diagnostic agreement (abnormal versus normal) was present in 28 of the 30 patients (p less than 0.001).
 Regarding physiologic assessment as compared with thallium scintigraphy, the finding of infarction and ischemia was concordant in 89% and 86% of patients, respectively.
 This report describes the initial use of teboroxime with a rapid dynamic planar imaging technique, resulting in a high correlation with exercise thallium scintigraphy.
 Delayed postexercise images obtained 5 to 10 min after exercise demonstrated rapid disappearance of exercise-induced defects noted on the initial (0 to 5 min) postexercise views.
 The rapid differential washout with teboroxime has not been previously described and the possible clinical significance is discussed.

"Effects of FUdR on primary-cultured colon carcinomas metastatic to the liver.
 Hepatic arterial infusion of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of metastatic colorectal carcinoma of the liver.
 In this study, the direct cytotoxic effect of FUdR was measured on ten metastatic and two primary-site colorectal carcinomas in a primary culture assay system.
 Overall, clinically achievable concentrations of FUdR (0.4 to 4 microM) induced partial cell kill in 75% of tumors, including a greater than 50% reduction in viable tumor cell number in only two tumors and less than 50% in the remaining seven.
 Total cell kill was not observed in any tumor.
 Three tumors were resistant to these FUdR concentrations.
 Tumor sensitivity correlated with the size of the tumor growth fraction.
 Increasing the exposure time to FUdR from 3 to 7 days approximately doubled the magnitude of the response.
 5-Flurouracil and cisplatin, at clinically achievable concentrations, were more toxic to metastatic tumor cells than FUdR.
 Because of the limited chemosensitivity of metastatic colorectal tumor cells to FUdR in vitro, we postulate that other mechanisms besides direct cytotoxicity contribute to the clinical efficacy of FUdR in vivo.

"New primary basal cell carcinomas arising in skin flaps following Mohs micrographic surgery for primary and recurrent basal cell carcinoma.
 Two patients developed new primary basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) in skin flaps used to reconstruct wounds that followed an earlier primary BCC and a recurrent BCC treated by Mohs micrographic surgery.
 Criteria for distinguishing a new primary BCC arising in a skin flap or full-thickness skin graft at a previous treatment site for BCC from a truly recurrent BCC are presented.
 The distinction between a new primary BCC and true tumor recurrence is important for accurate clinical assessment and may have a dramatic impact on the type of subsequent treatment.
 In addition, there may be less medicolegal liability in the case of a new primary BCC arising at the site of a previously treated BCC than for a BCC that is determined to be recurrent.

"Left ventricular filling impairment in asymptomatic chronic alcoholics.
 Systolic left ventricular dysfunction is relatively common in even asymptomatic alcoholics, but whether diastolic function is also altered is much less well-studied.
 We used M-mode and Doppler echocardiography to study left ventricular size, mass, systolic function and diastolic filling in 32 alcoholics free of clinically detectable heart disease and in 15 healthy control subjects.
 Left ventricular mass index and posterior wall thickness were higher in alcoholics than in controls, but there was no statistically significant difference either in end-diastolic size or in systolic ventricular function.
 More abnormalities were found in the Doppler indexes of diastolic function, however.
 The alcoholics had a prolonged relaxation time (200 +/- 6 vs 184 +/- 5 ms [mean +/- standard error], p less than 0.05), a decreased peak early diastolic velocity (52 +/- 2 vs 60 +/- 3 cm/s, p less than 0.05), a slower acceleration of the early flow (410 +/- 18 vs 552 +/- 43 cm/s2, p less than 0.01), and a higher atrial-to-early peak velocity ratio (0.74 +/- 0.04 vs 0.60 +/- 0.05, p less than 0.05).
 This pattern of changes suggests a primary abnormality in the relaxation of the left ventricle.
 In multivariate analyses, the abnormalities in the Doppler indexes were independent of the duration of alcoholism, the quantity of the most recent ethanol exposure and the increased mass of the left ventricle.
 Impaired early filling of the left ventricle due to delayed relaxation is common in asymptomatic alcoholics and may in fact be the earliest functional sign of preclinical alcoholic cardiomyopathy.

"A comparison in vitro of human and rabbit distal colonic muscle responses to inflammatory mediators.
 The present study compared in vitro the motor responses of human and rabbit distal colonic longitudinal and circular muscle to acetylcholine, histamine, leukotrienes B4 and D4, and prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha.
 The active and passive mechanical properties of these muscles were also evaluated.
 All muscle types were contracted by acetylcholine and histamine.
 Longitudinal muscle from both species was contracted by prostaglandin E2 and prostaglandin F2 alpha, although rabbit muscle was more sensitive.
 Prostaglandin E2 relaxed the majority of both human and rabbit circular muscle preparations that were studied.
 Prostaglandin F2 alpha first relaxed and then contracted circular muscle from both species.
 Leukotriene B4 had no effect on any tissue studied.
 Leukotriene D4 caused transient relaxations in a proportion of all muscle types, but the relaxations were not concentration-related.
 Contractile responses did not differ under isotonic recording conditions, but relaxations were much more clearly defined.
 Based on experiments using atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, and pyrilamine or tetrodotoxin, it was concluded that the responses of both human and rabbit distal colonic muscles to these inflammatory mediators have a similar pharmacological basis.
 All muscle types exhibited low passive tension and developed active tension in the range 0.8-1.2 Lo.
 These data strongly support the belief that after the onset of an induced colitis, the rabbit colon has value as a predictive model for the study of inflammatory mediator-induced colonic motility changes in humans.

"Iatrogenic contamination of multidose vials in simulated use. A reassessment of current patient injection technique.
 An investigation of the potential spread of iatrogenic infections through contaminated multidose vials was performed.
 Contamination of a multidose vial was hypothesized to occur after a single syringe is used to inject an infected patient with medication, and the same syringe subsequently is used to withdraw additional medication from the multidose vial.
 If the contaminated multidose vial is used for another patient, an iatrogenic infection may be spread.
 Laboratory study of this injection technique found that viral plaque-forming units could be transmitted to a multidose vial in this manner.
 A survey of 100 fellows of the American Academy of Dermatology from the United States found that 24% of the respondents used this potentially unsafe procedure.
 The potential for iatrogenic spread of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B virus is described.

"Medical comorbidity of major depressive disorder in a primary medical practice.
 Despite much speculation about the relationship between depression and medical comorbidity in primary care settings, few investigators have examined this issue empirically.
 Using a two-stage screening procedure, we assessed 618 patients aged 18 to 64 years in an academic general medicine clinic.
 Forty-one patients (6.6%) suffered from a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD).
 We compared this group with a 20% random sample of nondepressed patients.
 While patients with MDD were younger (mean age, 41.1 vs 47.2 years), they were assessed by the Duke University Severity of Illness Scale as having more severe medical illness.
 Patients with MDD were more likely to have malignant tumors and ""ill-defined conditions"" than nondepressed patients.
 The 18 patients with MDD (44%) who were correctly diagnosed by their physicians had less severe medical illness than those whose depression was clinically undetected.
 A logistic regression model predicting MDD group membership included female gender, younger age, higher Duke University Severity of Illness Scale score, and more frequent inactive ill-defined diagnoses.
 These findings are consistent with assertions: (1) patients with MDD have more physical illness than nondepressed patients and/or (2) somatic symptoms and disability caused by MDD add to the burden of physical illness.

"Improved survival and reduced myocardial necrosis with cardiopulmonary bypass reperfusion in a canine model of coronary occlusion and cardiac arrest.
 STUDY QUESTION: Does cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) improve resuscitation rates and limit infarct size after cardiac arrest and acute myocardial infarction? DESIGN: Controlled randomized trial with all animals undergoing left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and subsequent ventricular fibrillation and resuscitation.
 All animals were supported for four hours after resuscitation in an intensive care setting.
 INTERVENTION: Group 1 (eight) was resuscitated with standard external CPR and advanced life support.
 Group 2 (eight) was resuscitated with CPB.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Group hemodynamic, resuscitation variables, number resuscitated, and number of four-hour survivors were compared.
 Ischemic and necrotic myocardial weights were determined with histochemical staining techniques in four-hour survivors.
 Infarct size was measured as the ratio of necrotic weight to ischemic weight.
 Significantly fewer dogs were resuscitated in group 1 (four of eight) than in group 2 (eight of eight) (P less than .05).
 Group 2 survivors required significantly less epinephrine and lidocaine than group 1 survivors (P less than .05) and higher aortic diastolic and coronary perfusion pressures after CPB (P less than .001).
 The ratio of myocardial necrotic weight to ischemic weight at four hours was 0.82 +/- 0.25 in group 1 and 0.22 +/- 0.25 in group 2 (P less than .05).
 However, collateral blood flow was not measured in this study.
 CONCLUSION: This pilot study further substantiates the improvement in resuscitation rates obtainable with CPB.
 CPB may also limit infarct size during the postresuscitation period and requires further study.

 Sixty-seven sera were revealed to be repeatedly positive.
 Analysis by Western blot confirmed the infection in four cases, an indeterminate (antibodies against only the gag-encoded proteins) pattern was revealed in 25 cases, whereas 38 sera were negative.
 Three of the four HIV-2-positive sera also reacted with two distinct, but close, synthetic peptides homologous to viral gp36.
 The fourth serum, which did not display antibodies against gp36 on Western blot, did not react with gp36-derived synthetic peptides.
 None of these sera reacted with native HIV-1 antigens or synthetic peptides homologous to gp41.
 Sera with an indeterminate HIV-2 Western blot did not react with gp36-derived synthetic peptides.
 Although 10 of them also displayed an indeterminate HIV-1 Western blot, no serum sample reacted with two gp41-derived synthetic peptides or proved to be positive when they tested for p24 antigen.
 One bisexual and one heterosexual HIV-2 positive subject reported sexual contacts with West Africans, whereas two other heterosexuals had had multiple sexual partners from different countries.

 z score was unrelated to underlying diagnosis, sex, or age but was significantly related to the duration of previous steroid therapy (r = -.38) and to the total cumulative glucocorticoid dose (r = -.50).
 The rate of change of bone density in 16 of these subjects followed up over a period of 12 months was -8.9% and was significantly greater in subjects taking more than 12.5 mg of prednisone per day.
 Bone loss was not influenced by sex, age, duration of previous steroid treatment, or diagnosis and was not predictable from biochemical measures of calcium metabolism.

"IL-1 regulation of transin/stromelysin transcription in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts appears to involve two antagonistic transduction pathways, an inhibitory, prostaglandin-dependent pathway mediated by cAMP, and a stimulatory, protein kinase C-dependent pathway.
 IL-1, like other agents that have been shown a capacity to induce protein kinase C, is a potent transcriptional activator of the metalloproteinase, stromelysin, in synovial and other fibroblasts.
 cAMP has been shown to inhibit stromelysin transcription in fibroblasts of nonsynovial origin, and is regarded as an important second messenger for IL-1.
 In addition to stimulating metalloproteinase transcription, IL-1 also induces PGE2 production in synoviocytes.
 We determined that rIL-1 alpha led to the time-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP in serum-starved rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts, and that the effect was blocked by indomethacin.
 The cAMP agonists forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and PGE2 suppressed the IL-1 induction of stromelysin; conversely, indomethacin superinduced IL-1-elicited stromelysin mRNA.
 These results were recapitulated on the transcriptional level in cells transfected with the rat transin/stromelysin promoter in a reporter (CAT) construct.
 2',5'-Dideoxyadenosine, an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, also augmented the IL-1 induction of stromeylsin mRNA, as did H-8, a specific inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A.
 Staurosporine and H-7, inhibitors of protein kinase C, blocked the IL-1 induction of stromelysin mRNA.
 We conclude that IL-1 appears to stimulate at least two transduction pathways in synovial fibroblasts from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and that these have antagonistic effects on the regulation of stromelysin transcription.

"Intraperitoneal yttrium-90-labeled monoclonal antibody in ovarian cancer 
 From March 1987 to March 1988, a phase I to II study was carried out in 25 patients with ovarian cancer.
 They received escalating doses of intraperitoneally (IP) administered yttrium-90 (Y-90)-labeled monoclonal antibody, HMFG1, against a tumor cell-surface antigen.
 Myelosuppression prevented an escalation of the administered Y-90 activity above 25 mCi.
 Y-90-labeled antibody was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity into the circulation.
 Maximum blood Y-90 activity was observed 40 hours after the IP injection with a mean of 21% of the injected activity (range, 14.2% to 26.4%) in the circulation.
 The radiation dose the bone marrow received from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody (the blood radiation dose) was calculated by applying the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formulation to the measured Y-90 activity in patients blood.
 Myelosuppression occurred following calculated blood radiation doses to bone marrow of only 10 to 30 cGy.
 The excessive myelosuppression following such modest radiation doses from circulating Y-90-labeled antibody could be explained by the uptake of Y-90 by bone.
 In an attempt to reduce bone absorption of Y-90, seven patients received an intravenous (IV) infusion of EDTA (Sinclair Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Godalming, United Kingdom).
 This increased the urinary excretion of Y-90 from a mean of 11.1% to 32.3% of the injected activity (P = .0001).
 Fourteen patients had assessable tumor at laparoscopy.
 Tumor regression was observed in one patient, and palliation of ascites in a further patient.

 Leukemic cells from a patient with Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had a normal karyotype.
 M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22.
 The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML.
 With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment.
 Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL.
 The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34.
 Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22.

"Mutation of the signal peptide-encoding region of the preproparathyroid hormone gene in familial isolated hypoparathyroidism.
 Preproparathyroid hormone (preproPTH) gene mutation has been proposed as a cause of familial isolated hypoparathyroidism (FIH).
 We cloned the preproPTH alleles of a patient with autosomal dominant FIH and sequenced the coding regions, 5' flanking regions, and splice junctions.
 The putatively abnormal (based on previous linkage studies) allele differed from the other allele's normal sequence at only one nucleotide.
 This T to C point mutation changes the codon for position 18 of the 31 amino acid prepro sequence from cysteine to arginine, disrupting the hydrophobic core of the signal sequence.
 Because the hydrophobic core is required by secreted proteins for efficient translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum, the mutant protein is likely to be inefficiently processed.
 Indeed, in vitro studies demonstrated dramatically impaired processing of the mutant preproPTH to proPTH.
 In summary, we observed a point mutation in the signal peptide-encoding region of a preproPTH gene in one FIH kindred and demonstrated a functional defect caused by the mutation.
 Mutation of the signal sequence constitutes a novel pathophysiologic mechanism in man, and further study may yield important insights both into this form of hormone deficiency and into the role of signal sequences in human physiology.

"Intraoperative ultrasonic imaging of the ascending aorta in ischemic heart disease.
 In an attempt to locate any atherosclerotic lesion in the ascending aorta and to prevent embolization, intraoperative B-mode ultrasonography was performed in 100 patients with ischemic heart disease (31 women and 69 men).
 Ultrasonography was carried out with a 10-MHz probe placed directly on the ascending aorta.
 Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated an atherosclerotic lesion in the lower half of the aorta in 76 patients (76%), a lesion in the upper half of the aorta in 89 patients (89%), and a lesion at the orifice of the innominate artery in 99 patients (99%).
 Prospective palpation identified an atherosclerotic lesion in 12 (25%) of 48 patients.
 Thoracic computed tomography in 79 patients showed calcification in the lower half of the aorta in 6 patients (7.6%) and in the upper half of the aorta in 11 (13.9%).
 Palpation and thoracic computed tomography underestimated the frequency of atherosclerotic lesions.

"Immunization of owl monkeys with a combination of Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage synthetic peptide antigens.
 A mixture of 3 synthetic peptides (35.1, 55.1, and 83.1) corresponding to portions of the 35 kDa, 55 kDa, and 83 kDa proteins from the asexual blood stages of Plasmodium falciparum and a polymer of a syntheic peptide incorporating the 3 individual peptides (SPf66) were tested as candidate malaria vaccine antigens in Aotus nancymai.
 Monkeys were immunized with combinations of the 3 peptides from 2 separate sources (Centers for Disease Control [CDC], Atlanta, GA or Colombia) or with the synthetic polymer.
 Animals immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides from CDC had higher antibody titers to the 35.1 and 55.1 peptides than to the 83.1 peptide.
 Monkeys immunized with a combination of the 3 peptides produced in Colombia developed higher levels of antibody to the 55.1 than to the 83.1 and 35.1 peptides.
 Animals immunized with the polymer produced detectable antibodies to the 55.1 peptide alone.
 Following challenge with P.
 falciparum, no differences were observed between the 3 vaccine groups and 2 control groups with respect to the number of animals with parasitemias greater than or equal to 10%.
 The inconsistency of serologic response to all 3 peptides in these animals contrasted with previous trials performed in Colombia where the monkeys developed high antibody titers against the 3 peptides and were protected against the experimental infection.

"Epidemiology of epilepsy in Guaymi Indians from Bocas del Toro Province, Republic of Panama.
 This cross-sectional study was conducted to describe the epidemiology of epilepsy in Guaymi Indians residing in Changuinola, a small town on Panama's Caribbean coast near Costa Rica.
 We randomly selected households and attempted to enroll all residents aged less than or equal to 1 year; 337 eligible subjects agreed to participate (93% response rate).
 We administered a standard neurologic disease screening examination to all subjects and, if any abnormality was found, we administered a standard neurologic evaluation.
 We detected 19 cases of active epilepsy; the mean age at onset was 12 years, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures were the most common diagnosis (10 of 19, 53%).
 The prevalence of active epilepsy among Caribbean coastal Guaymi (57/1000) is considerably greater than that in lower class Panama City populations (22/1000) or in other parts of the world.
 To identify risk factors for epilepsy, we collected epidemiologic data and serum (for Cysticercus antibody) from subjects with active epilepsy and from 44 age/sex-matched controls.
 Significantly more cases (47%) than controls (6%) had other family members with epilepsy (relative risk, RR = 14); 44% of cases and 13% of controls reported a history of febrile seizures during childhood (RR = 6).

 An intellectually delayed adult ingested and aspirated a large quantity of polyurethane foam, developing acute respiratory failure in association with partial airway obstruction.
 The foam was identified by flexible bronchoscopy and successfully removed from the bronchus intermedius and left mainstem bronchus with a retrieval basket.
 This facilitated normalization of blood gases and eventual recovery.
 However, the unobstructed right upper lobe became infiltrated radiographically, presumably resulting from regional hyperinflation and/or occult focal aspiration.

"Screening for early dementia using memory complaints from patients and relatives.
 This study examined whether the subjective impression of memory function might differentiate healthy elderly subjects from patients with memory complaints, and whether memory complaints differed between patients with and without a dementing illness.
 Both self-assessment and relatives' responses on a new memory questionnaire differentiated patient groups from control subjects.
 The relatives' form measuring deterioration in memory function over time identified dementing individuals from those with non-dementing causes for their memory complaints.
 Factor analysis indicated that patients' memory complaints correlated with depression rather than objective memory performance, while relatives' ratings correlated with objective memory scores, not depression.
 Stepwise discriminant function analyses showed that objective memory testing greatly improved specificity but not sensitivity of the subjective memory questionnaire alone.

"Tryptase, a mediator of human mast cells.
 Tryptase, a mediator secreted by human mast cells during immediate reactions, has demonstrated effects on several pathways in vitro.
 This enzyme can rapidly inactivate fibrinogen and, as a complex with heparin, may prevent coagulation that may otherwise occur when plasma enters tissues at sites of immediate reactions.
 Tryptase may also activate prostromelysin, which in turn activates latent collagenase.
 When canine pulmonary smooth muscle is incubated with canine tryptase, the contractile response to histamine is increased.
 Tryptase, quantifiable in complex biologic fluids by immunoassay, can serve as a specific indicator of mast cell involvement in certain clinical settings.
 For example, after bee sting--induced anaphylaxis, tryptase levels in the blood peak at approximately 1 hour, then decline with a half-life of approximately 2 hours.
 Additionally, elevated tryptase levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of asymptomatic, atopic persons with asthma suggest ongoing mast cell activation, which may relate to adenosine hyperresponsiveness and a persistence of bronchial hyperreactivity.
 Tryptase levels in bronchial lavage fluid of atopic patients with asthma rise markedly after endobronchial allergen challenge but not after an exercise challenge, suggesting a lack of mast cell involvement in the latter condition.

"Barrett's esophagus in children and young adults. Frequent association with mental retardation.
 Since few data are available on epidemiologic features of Barrett's esophagus in young persons, we reviewed the case records of patients undergoing esophageal biopsies at Children's Hospital, Boston, from 1982 through 1986.
 There were 1423 esophageal biopsies obtained from 1173 patients, and histological evidence of esophagitis was present in 397 cases; Barrett's epithelium was diagnosed in 10 patients (0.9% of total and 2.5% of esophagitis cases).
 Specialized columnar epithelium was present in seven of these 10 patients.
 The mean age of those with Barrett's epithelium was 19.0 +/- 7.9 years (range 3.7-27 years) compared to 8.7 +/- 6.7 years (range 4 days to 31 years) for all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0001); 80% (8/10) of the Barrett's cases were male compared to 54% of all cases.
 The relative importance of the possible risk factors was assessed by comparing the 10 patients with Barrett's with the 541 patients that had esophageal biopsies in calendar years 1984-1985.
 Mental retardation, a risk factor not previously described for young persons with Barrett's esophagitis, was present in 70% (7/10) of the Barrett's patients but in only 15% of all patients biopsied (P less than 0.0002).
 The frequency of mental retardation was also higher, but not significantly so (P greater than 0.07), in patients with biopsies that were positive for esophagitis (19%) than in those with normal biopsies (14%).
 No significant differences were found between the Barrett's group and all patients biopsied in regards to racial origin, prior stricture, or fundoplication.

"Giant eccrine acrospiroma.
 Four cases of large eccrine acrospiroma (three benign, one malignant) are reported.
 The benign tumors involved the lower extremities of two women and one man (73 to 89 years of age).
 The duration of the lesions ranged from 10 to 20 years.
 The malignant tumor involved the left side of the chest of a 60-year-old man.
 Its occurrence in a lesion that had been present for 40 years suggested malignant transformation of a pre-existing benign eccrine acrospiroma.
 Each tumor showed little to no cellular atypia.
 Mitotic rates (mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields) varied both between and within lesions.
 Average mitotic rates did not differentiate the benign from the malignant tumors.
 The most important distinguishing features of large benign eccrine acrospiromas are the relative circumscription, the lack of cellular atypia, and the absence of stromal, perineurial, and angiolymphatic invasion.

"Total hip arthroplasty after fracture of the acetabulum. Long-term results.
 We made a retrospective study of 55 primary total hip arthroplasties in 53 patients with a history of previous acetabular fracture.
 The mean follow-up was 7.5 years and the average age at fracture was 48.7 years.
 The incidence of radiographic femoral loosening (29.4%), symptomatic loosening (15.7%), and femoral revision (7.8%) were similar to those previously reported at 10 years for routine arthroplasties by Stauffer (1982).
 On the acetabular side, the incidence of radiographic loosening (52.9%), symptomatic loosening (27.5%), and revision (13.7%) were four to five times higher.
 We conclude that a history of prior acetabular fracture has a significant adverse impact on the long-term outcome of any subsequent total hip arthroplasty.

"Recombinant human erythropoietin does not increase clotting in vascular accesses.
 The incidence of vascular access clotting was evaluated over 5.25 years.
 The first 32 months served as a control period.
 During the second period of 31 months, recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin) was used for an average duration of 13 months (range, 2-32 months) in 79 patients.
 The overall incidence of vascular access clotting decreased from a monthly rate of 0.06 to 0.03 events per patient-month over the 5 year period.
 Distribution of the number of events per patient did not differ between the two periods, with 55% to 60% of patients having no clotting episode.
 Patients with recurrent clotting (two or more events) accounted for 68% of episodes.
 During the second period, there were no differences in the incidence of vascular access clotting in epoetin treated patients vs untreated patients (0.38 events per patient-year vs.
 0.46 events per patient-year, both slightly lower than in period 1 [0.52 events per patient-year]).
 It is concluded that epoetin does not increase vascular access clotting.

"Predictive value of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium as a clinical marker for familial adenomatous polyposis.
 One hundred forty-eight members of 53 kindreds with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) were examined for congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE) and extracolonic manifestations (ECM) to assess the value of CHRPE as a predictive marker for FAP.
 Based on eye examination results, the families were divided into 2 groups.
 In a first group of 34 families, all 61 members diagnosed as having polyps and 13 of the 33 patients at risk had 4 or more lesions distributed in both eyes.
 By contrast, in a second group of 18 families, all 32 polyposis patients and all 18 members at risk had less than 4 lesions.
 Extra-colonic manifestations were present in 26 of 34 families in the first group and in 11 of 18 families in the second group.
 Data on one family with ambiguous ancestry were reviewed separately.
 The existence of 4 or more CHRPE lesions distributed in both eyes seems to be a congenital marker for FAP, present in 65.4 percent of families.
 When present in a family: 1) it is found in all diagnosed patients in that family, 2) can therefore be considered predictive for the development of polyps in other family members who carry the trait, and 3) if confirmed by longer follow-up, may possibly preclude members without the trait from further evaluation and surveillance.

"Current concepts of beta-endorphin physiology in female reproductive dysfunction.
 beta-Endorphin has a role in the regulation of the normal menstrual cycle and possibly in the onset of puberty.
 We have reviewed the evidence pointing to an alteration in this neuropeptide that may contribute to the pathogenesis of various reproductive dysfunctions.
 Elevated or high levels of beta-endorphin have been associated with exercise-associated amenorrhea, stress-associated amenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.
 Depressed or low levels of beta-endorphin have been associated with PMS and menopause.
 Alterations in the levels of beta-endorphin may change the pulsatile release of GnRH via noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic pathways.
 We have primarily focused on beta-endorphin as representative of the endogenous opioid peptides, but other opioid peptides may also contribute to the pathogenesis of various types of reproductive dysfunction.
 Perhaps it will become possible to characterize and hone our understanding of the function of beta-endorphin and the other substances composing the endogenous opioid peptides.
 A better understanding of their role in physiological as well as pathophysiological processes may allow for the development of rational approaches to the treatment of specific disorders pertaining to reproduction.
 Many questions remain unanswered.
 Among the most relevant are: what is the precise mechanism of action by which beta-endorphin exerts its influence on pulsatile GnRH release? Is there a functional relationship between CNS and peripheral (serum) levels of beta-endorphin? Are the detected changes in beta-endorphin levels merely associated, or are they a cause of a particular disorder? Since it took almost 40 years between the time prostaglandins were first discovered and eventual realization of their clinical application, it may take some time before the beta-endorphin story is complete.

 Myasthenia Gravis is a disorder of neuromuscular function resulting from an immunologically based premature destruction of acetylcholine receptors.
 The disease is characterized clinically by variable weakness accentuated by repetitive muscular activity and usually responding to the administration of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.
 Myasthenia Gravis is a complex disease and requires understanding of the many facets of its natural history and immunological basis to ensure optimal individual patient management.
 The long-term goal is control of the immunological imbalance; treatment regimens include thymectomy, corticosteroids, azathioprine, and plasmapheresis.
 The common use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors provides symptomatic relief during variable daily muscular activity.
 Disability due to myasthenia gravis is to a large extent reversible and death is preventable.
 Early recognition of myasthenia gravis and appropriate treatment are often rewarded by remission that may be permanent.

"Systems architecture for quantification of dynamic myoelectric and kinematic activity of the human vocal tract.
 This paper describes a systems architecture useful for scientific investigations that require the acquisition and analysis of multiple, time-synchronous signals in large volume.
 The architecture has recently been developed by this group to enhance our capability to research and quantify central nervous system function in the production of normal and pathologic speech.
 The architecture utilizes modern advances in desktop microcomputers and has been designed so that vocal motor control laboratories (or similar settings) with modest funding can more fully participate in comprehensive investigations of speech production.
 Research experiments organized with this architecture may involve many more subjects and measures than previously possible without significant increases in time and personnel resources.
 This paper will demonstrate the technique and practicality of this architecture as it is being used to successfully guide research to map hierarchic central nervous system regions of involvement in two speech disorders: spasmodic dysphonia and stuttering.
 The architecture has broad usefulness to many areas of otolaryngology and health science.

"Zidovudine (Retrovir) update.
 Zidovudine (AZT) is the first antiretroviral agent to be licensed for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Since the initial placebo-controlled trial showing improved survival among patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or symptomatic HIV infection (AIDS-related complex [ARC]) zidovudine has been evaluated in other stages of HIV infection.
 This review offers physicians who treat patients with HIV infection a comprehensive analysis of the current data on the clinical efficacy of zidovudine in various stages of HIV infection and on zidovudine's adverse effects.
 After a search of MEDLINE for pertinent articles published since 1985, controlled studies and studies of long-term zidovudine therapy, of zidovudine therapy for HIV-related conditions and of the incidence and management of adverse reactions were evaluated.
 In addition, abstracts from international meetings were reviewed.
 No significant difference in clinical outcome was found between high-dose and low-dose zidovudine therapy, but there were significantly fewer toxic effects in the low-dose group.
 In two other studies zidovudine was found to delay disease progression in patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection who had an absolute CD4 count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L; the low incidence of adverse reactions may have been due to either the early stage of the infection or the low dose used.
 The demonstration of zidovudine-resistant isolates after at least 6 months of therapy has yet to be correlated with clinical deterioration.
 When to begin zidovudine therapy among asymptomatic patients with a CD4 count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L remains unclear.
 Zidovudine can be used safely to delay progression to AIDS or ARC in certain patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic HIV infection and can prolong survival in those with more severe infection.
 Further studies are necessary to identify indicators that could better define when to start treatment and how to alleviate toxic effects.
 Combination therapy with such agents as interferon alpha may become the preferred choice of therapy to prevent toxic effects and zidovudine resistance.
 Zidovudine prophylaxis has been used after HIV exposure.
 Although studies with animal models have had encouraging results infection has occurred despite immediate prophylaxis and thus further investigation is required.

"Stress adaptation and low-frequency impedance of rat lungs.
 At transpulmonary pressures (Ptp) of 7-12 cmH2O, pressure-volume hysteresis of isolated cat lungs has been found to be 20-50% larger than predicted from their amount of stress adaptation (J.
 Hildebrandt, J.
 Appl.
 Physiol.
 28: 365-372, 1970).
 This behavior is inconsistent with linear viscoelasticity and has been interpreted in terms of plastoelasticity.
 We have reinvestigated this phenomenon in isolated lungs from 12 Wistar rats by measuring 1) the changes in Ptp after 0.5-ml step volume changes (initial Ptp of 5 cmH2O) and 2) their response to sinusoidal pressure forcing from 0.01 to 0.67 Hz (2 cmH2O peak to peak, mean Ptp of 6 cmH2O).
 Stress adaptation curves were found to fit approximately Hildebrandt's logarithmic model [delta Ptp/delta V = A - B.log(t)] from 0.2 to 100 s, where delta V is the step volume change, A and B are coefficients, and t is time.
 A and B averaged 1.06 +/- 0.11 and 0.173 +/- 0.019 cmH2O/ml, respectively, with minor differences between stress relaxation and stress recovery curves.
 The response to sinusoidal forcing was characterized by the effective resistance (Re) and elastance (EL).
 Re decreased from 2.48 +/- 0.41 cmH2O.ml-1.s at 0.01 Hz to 0.18 +/- 0.03 cmH2O.ml-1.s at 0.5 Hz, and EL increased from 0.99 +/- 0.10 to 1.26 +/- 0.20 cmH2O/ml on the same frequency range.

"Effect of normal MSAFP screening on maternal age for genetic amniocentesis.
 Routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening for neural tube defects is considered by many to be standard obstetrical care, and recently many have encouraged this test to screen for Trisomy-21 (Down's syndrome).
 We questioned whether, after a normal MSAFP screen, the risk of Trisomy-21 decreases enough to warrant modifying the recommended age for genetic amniocentesis for Down's syndrome.
 A logistic regression was developed which, using reported values for sensitivity and specificity for MSAFP detection of Trisomy-21 and assuming a constant threshold risk in opting for amniocentesis, indicates that genetic amniocentesis for Trisomy-21 may be deferred in some women who have a normal MSAFP screening.
 Sensitivity analysis of varying thresholds for a normal MSAFP demonstrates that a 37 year old woman with a median MSAFP level has the same risk for Trisomy-21 as an unscreened women who is 4.5 years younger.
 An abnormal MSAFP is useful in screening for neural tube defects and possibly for Trisomy-21.
 A normal MSAFP may allow for delaying the potentially risky amniocentesis in otherwise low-risk pregnancies.

"X-linked spinal muscular atrophy (Kennedy's syndrome). A kindred with hypobetalipoproteinemia.
 Kennedy's syndrome, X-linked adult-onset bulbospinal muscular atrophy, has been described in over 30 families.
 The characteristic distribution of weakness creates a recognizable syndrome, augmented by frequent findings of testicular atrophy and gynecomastia.
 Type IV or type II hyperlipoproteinemia has been found in some families.
 We have studied another family with Kennedy's syndrome, this one with hypobetalipoproteinemia.
 The diversity of serum patterns suggests that lipoprotein abnormalities are not causally related to either the endocrinopathy or the spinal muscular atrophy.
 However, gene linkage studies indicate proximity of the gene for Kennedy's syndrome and the gene encoding the androgen receptor, which could explain the combination of a motor neuron disorder and the endocrine abnormalities.

"Equal parental origin of chromosome 22 losses in human sporadic meningioma: no evidence for genomic imprinting.
 Inactivation of tumor suppressor genes can occur either by mutation at the gene locus or by loss of part or all of the chromosome region containing the gene.
 The latter is most frequently detected by DNA markers as loss of heterozygosity in the tumor tissue.
 In several reports, the paternal homologue was preferentially retained in embryonal tumors associated with loss of particular chromosomal regions, suggesting genomic imprinting of the corresponding tumor suppressor loci.
 To explore the generality of these findings and the possible role of genomic imprinting in adult tumors of the nervous system, we have determined the parental origin of chromosome 22 loss in sporadic meningioma.
 Of nine cases studied, five tumors retained the maternally derived chromosome 22 homologue while four retained the paternally derived chromosome 22.
 Thus, in contrast to the embryonal tumors, the meningioma locus on chromosome 22 is inactivated by random mutation in sporadic adult meningiomas.

"True hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, 46,XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.
 The first case (to the authors' knowledge) is reported of a true hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, a 46, XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.
 The true hermaphroditism was diagnosed during infancy.
 The patient was subsequently found to have a gonadoblastoma and a microscopic dysgerminoma in the gonad diagnosed as an ovotestis and excised during infancy.
 The successful pregnancy occurred when the patient was 29 years old.
 A year later a large gonadal tumor affecting the remaining gonad was excised.
 The gonad was found to be an ovotestis, and the tumor was a dysgerminoma arising from a gonadoblastoma.
 This case further emphasizes the malignant potential of the Y chromosome in patients with abnormal gonads.

"Overnight admission of outpatient strabismus patients.
 The trend to outpatient strabismus surgery prompted us to determine the frequency of, and the reasons for, postoperative overnight hospital admission following such surgery.
 In one year, 303 outpatient strabotomies were performed at the Jules Stein Eye Institute on patients over 15 months old.
 Twenty-four (7.9%) were admitted overnight postoperatively.
 Compared with controls, those admitted were older (37 vs 20.5 years), and had a longer duration of anesthesia (145 vs 116 minutes) and surgery (104 vs 75 minutes) (P less than .01 for each).
 The time that surgery commenced and the use of perioperative medications were not significant factors.
 The most frequent reasons for overnight admission were nausea (38%) despite prophylaxis and the use of bilateral patches (16%).
 To minimize postoperative admissions, better strategies should be developed to decrease the frequency of significant postoperative nausea, the duration of surgery and anesthesia, and, if possible, the use of bilateral patches.

"Review of the all-polyethylene tibial component in total knee arthroplasty. A minimum seven-year follow-up period.
 A retrospective analysis of 144 total knee arthroplasties was performed between 1975 and 1981 with a minimum follow-up period of seven years.
 A posterior cruciate condylar prosthesis was used in each procedure.
 Patients were followed clinically and roentgenographically, and a set of statistical variables was established based on elevation in joint line, tibial component angular alignment, overall limb alignment, and position of the tibial component on anteroposterior and lateral roentgenograms.
 Review of the study group found that the Hospital for Special Surgery knee scores improved from a preoperative score of 55 to a postoperative score of 88, with 94.5% having good or excellent results.
 The mean postoperative range of motion was 106 degrees with a mean extension of -0.3 degrees.
 Radiolucencies developed in 41% of the knees with 5% of the knees having progressive radiolucencies.
 Eight knees were considered failures based on clinical and roentgenographic evaluations.
 Factors found to significantly affect the formation of radiolucent lines included a shift of the tibial component medially by greater than 4 mm, a varus tilt of the tibial component greater than 2 degrees, and the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.
 The only variable associated with aseptic loosening was an elevation of the joint line by greater than 8 mm.

"Effect of PAF-acether inhalation on nonspecific bronchial reactivity and adrenergic response in normal and asthmatic subjects.
 Bronchial hyperreactivity, although recognized as a hallmark of asthma, is not totally understood.
 Mast cell-derived mediators, including histamine, have been shown to cause immediate bronchoconstriction, but until recently, no single mediator has been shown to induce prolonged changes in airway reactivity.
 Recent reports indicate PAF-acether (PAF) can induce increased nonspecific bronchial reactivity in normal subjects but not in asthmatics.
 We sought to elucidate the role of PAF in airway hyperreactivity by comparing the effect of inhaled PAF on methacholine and isoproterenol airway responsiveness in six nonasthmatic and six asthmatic subjects.
 Neither nonspecific airway reactivity nor isoproterenol responsiveness was changed following PAF inhalation in the nonasthmatic subjects in the six days following PAF.
 Asthmatics had increased airway responsiveness to methacholine at two hours post-PAF, which did not persist.
 Responsiveness to isoproterenol did not change in the asthmatic subjects.
 Additional evaluation of the role of PAF in causing changes in airway reactivity is warranted.

"Treating systemic fungal infections in AIDS patients. Prolonging life against the odds.
 Fungal infections have become one of the major causes of death among immunocompromised patients, particularly patients with AIDS.
 Accurate and quick diagnosis is difficult; therefore, empirical therapy is often necessary.
 This scenario is complicated by the fact that most antifungal agents are toxic at the doses used or relatively ineffective against deep-seated mycoses.
 Because the population of AIDS patients is increasing, physicians will be faced more often with the management of systemic fungal infections.
 Despite the current bleak prognosis for these patients, several new antigen detection tests are being developed and triazole agents are proving to be effective and less toxic than their predecessors.
 Many cases of systemic mycoses do result in mortality, but appropriate treatment can both prolong life and improve its quality.

"Cytomegalovirus infection in children with AIDS.
 Data for 38 children perinatally exposed to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were evaluated to determine the impact of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on the course of perinatally acquired HIV infection.
 Thirteen children belonged to the P0 (indeterminate) group, one to the P1 (asymptomatic) group, and 24 to the P2 (symptomatic) group, per the classification of the Centers for Disease Control.
 Of the 24 children in the P2 group, 10 died.
 The mean follow-up time was 22.8 months for the 10 children who died and 16.3 months for the 13 children in the P0 group.
 Serial cultures of urine were performed for all 38 patients.
 CMV was isolated from seven of 10 children who died and from four of 14 children who survived (P less than .05).
 Only one of the 13 P0 children was culture-positive for CMV, as compared with 11 of 24 P2 children (P less than .05).
 All CMV-infected children continued to demonstrate CMV viruria in serial cultures.
 The mean age at the time of the first culture positive for CMV was 13 months.
 Microcephaly was present in 15 (65%) of 23 P2 children but in none of the P0 and P1 children (P less than .05).
 Eight of 11 CMV-infected children were microcephalic; seven of 12 children not infected with CMV were microcephalic (P greater than .05).
 These data suggest that the prevalence of active CMV infection is significantly higher in P2 children than in P0 and P1 children.
 In addition, there is a significant association between CMV infection and mortality among P2 children.

"Differential light scattering cuvettes for the measurement of thromboemboli in high shear blood flow systems.
 Newly developed optical scattering cuvettes were constructed as a modification of our existing 1.0 mm and 3.0 mm internal diameter (ID) cuvettes to facilitate the measurement of platelet microemboli ranging from 20 microns to 1,000 microns diameter in whole blood in 0.9 mm ID flows ranging from 250 to 4,000 ml/min.
 A perturbation solution to the one-speed radiative transport equation was used in the design and calibration of these cuvettes.
 A series of tests were performed with these cuvettes in an extracorporeal left ventricular assist device bovine model, and in a recirculating closed-loop flow system containing anticoagulated whole baboon blood, to determine to what extent they affect platelet and erythrocyte function ex vivo and in vitro.
 Serial hemolysis tests, thromboxane radioimmunoassay measurements, platelet counts, and activated partial thromboplastin times were measured.
 All of these tests with cuvettes in the extracorporeal and in vitro circuits were statistically indistinguishable from baseline measurements, suggesting the usefulness of this system for the measurement of microemboli in blood-contacting materials of extracorporeal circuits and cardiac assist devices.

"Relationship of drusen and abnormalities of the retinal pigment epithelium to the prognosis of neovascular macular degeneration. The Macular Photocoagulation Study Group.
 We graded macular features of 127 fellow eyes of participants in the Macular Photocoagulation Study who had an extrafoveal choroidal neovascular membrane secondary to age-related macular degeneration in the first eye and no initial evidence of the neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration in the fellow eye.
 Our aims were to determine the relationship of drusen characteristics and retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities to the risk of subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye and the risk of subsequent development of recurrent neovascular membranes after photocoagulation in the first eye.
 Regression analysis demonstrated that the presence of large drusen and focal hyperpigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium were independent risk factors for the subsequent development of neovascularization in the fellow eye (relative risk, 2.4 and 2.5, respectively).
 Only 10% of eyes with no large drusen or any retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation compared with 58% of eyes with both large drusen and retinal pigment epithelial hyperpigmentation developed neovascularization in the fellow eye within 5 years.
 Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, we noted that the risk of developing recurrent neovascular membranes in the first eye was significantly increased when large drusen (relative risk, 2.8) were noted in the fellow eye at the time of laser treatment in the first eye.
 Fundus features in the fellow eye appear to help identify patients at high risk of developing visual loss from recurrent neovascular membranes following laser treatment in the first eye and from development of a neovascular membrane in the fellow eye.

"Influence of organ environment on extracellular matrix degradative activity and metastasis of human colon carcinoma cells 
 Orthotopic implantation of human colon carcinoma cells is useful for studying the behavior of metastatic subpopulations.
 We observed that the parental line and variants of human colon carcinoma KM12 cells were all tumorigenic following implantation into the subcutis or cecal wall of BALB/c nude mice.
 Their ability to metastasize to distant organ sites varied, however, with the site of growth.
 Subcutaneous (SC) tumors did not produce visceral metastases, whereas cecal tumors metastasized to the regional mesenteric lymph nodes and to the liver.
 To examine the influence of organ environment on the extracellular matrix-degrading activity of the tumors, we inoculated human colon carcinoma cells into the subcutis or cecal wall and after 7 weeks isolated and cultured the tumors in serum-free medium.
 The conditioned media of SC tumors contained very low levels of type IV collagenase (gelatinase) and heparanase (heparan sulfate-specific endo-beta-D-glucuronidase), whereas the media of the cecal wall tumors contained high levels of both.
 Zymograms of the media revealed that the intracecal human colon carcinomas secreted more than three times the amount of latent and active forms of 92-kd type IV collagenase than did the SC tumors.
 Moreover, only the conditioned media of intracecal tumors contained latent and active forms of 64-kd type IV collagenase.
 Histochemical analysis using rabbit antiserum raised against the synthetic peptides of 72-kd procollagenase type IV showed type IV collagenase in the intracecal tumors; human colon carcinoma growing SC, however, were not stained significantly.
 These results suggest that factors in the organ environment may affect production and secretion of tumor extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes, and these factors may modify the metastatic behavior of human colon carcinoma cells in nude mice.

"Doppler assessment of pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxic breathing in subjects susceptible to high altitude pulmonary edema.
 To verify the abnormal pulmonary vascular response implicated in the pathogenesis of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), we examined the hemodynamic responses to hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible subjects (HAPE-S) by means of both right heart catheterization and pulsed Doppler echocardiography.
 The HAPE-S were seven men and one woman with a history of HAPE.
 Six healthy volunteers who had repeated experiences of mountain climbing without any history of altitude-related problems served as control subjects.
 The HAPE-S showed much greater increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than did the control subjects, resulting in a much higher level of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) under acute hypoxia both of 15% O2 and 10% O2.
 We then evaluated the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography in the prediction of pulmonary hypertension.
 Acceleration time (AcT) and right ventricular ejection time (RVET) were measured from the flow velocity pattern in the right ventricular outflow tract.
 The ratio of AcT to RVET was correlated to invasively determined mean Ppa (Ppa) and PVR.
 The results were as follows: (1) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.0047 (Ppa), r = -0.93, SEE = 0.017, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (2) AcT/RVET = 0.55 to 0.0055 (Ppa), r = -0.70, SEE = 0.030, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (4) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.00077 (PVR), r = -0.91, SEE = 0.016, p less than 0.001 (control subjects).
 We conclude that HAPE-S have a constitutional abnormality in the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, which is a possible causative factor of HAPE, and that pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be supportive to assess the pulmonary vascular pressor response in the HAPE-S.

 An analysis is made of the pattern of presenting premenstrual symptoms in randomly selected general practice patients from the Wellington region, New Zealand.
 Participants, 1826 healthy women 16-54 years old whose characteristics were reasonably representative of the adult female population, were asked about their general, obstetrical and gynaecological health.
 For the 1456 women who had menstruated within the last month or so, detailed questions were asked about the last menstrual cycle.
 Each woman was assigned to one of seven premenstrual symptom sets.
 Three groups had 'pure' symptoms, ie a predominant single symptom (breast tenderness, bloating or irritability).
 Three groups had 'mixed' symptom-sets.
 The largest of the 'mixed' groups was formed by the women who reported breast tenderness, bloating and irritability together with tension and depression.
 Women in this group were most likely to rate their symptomatology as severe.

 In-vitro measurements of the pressure drop across six arterial cannulae at varying flow rates were performed using human blood with a hematocrit of 43%.
 Shear stress, Reynold's number, velocity, and pressure drop were calculated for each catheter at flow rates from 50 to 1,000 cc/min.
 The maximum mean flow rate to maintain the shear stress, Reynold's number, velocity, and pressure drop within the accepted range, was determined for each cannula.
 Recommended maximum blood flow rates for each of the six cannulae are given.

 In 94 consecutive patients undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart defects the results of intraoperative (after cardiopulmonary bypass) epicardial two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging were compared with those of sequential transthoracic echocardiography performed within 24 h of surgery and again before hospital discharge to define the precise role of intraoperative imaging.
 In 6 of 7 patients with a residual defect requiring immediate surgical revision, intraoperative imaging correctly identified the defect; spectral Doppler imaging underestimated or did not identify a residual outflow tract gradient in 17 patients.
 Left atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation after repair of complete AV septal defect was underestimated in three patients.
 Although intraoperative documentation of good ventricular function was usually associated with a good outcome, in three patients poor systemic ventricular function after cardiopulmonary bypass was not associated with early mortality.
 A minor degree of shunting around the patch was a common finding on epicardial and early postoperative imaging and persisted at the time of hospital discharge in 17 of 46 patients who had undergone patch closure of a ventricular septal defect as part of the surgical procedure.
 Additional trabecular septal defects were missed on color flow imaging after cardiopulmonary bypass in three patients, one of whom required subsequent reoperation.
 Although intraoperative two-dimensional and color flow imaging permitted the recognition of the majority of residual defects requiring immediate revision, residual outflow obstruction or AV valve regurgitation was usually underestimated.

 OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of synthetic 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) in the treatment of osteoporosis.
 DESIGN: Two-year, double-blind, randomized clinical trial.
 SETTING: University medical center.
 PATIENTS: Fifty postmenopausal women with vertebral fractures recruited by referral.
 INTERVENTION: Calcium intake was adjusted to 25 mmol/d (1000 mg/d) at baseline.
 Patients were then randomized to treatment with either calcitriol or placebo.
 During the study, calcium intake was reduced to 15 mmol/d (600 mg/d) and the dose of calcitriol was adjusted to maintain serum calcium less than 2.74 mmol/L (less than 11.0 mg/dL) or urine calcium less than 9.96 mmol/d (less than 400 mg/d).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: After 2 years, the mean dose of calcitriol in the treated group was 0.62 micrograms/d.
 Bone mineral density of the spine increased 1.94% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 3.92% with placebo (P = 0.001).
 Total body calcium increased 0.21% with calcitriol therapy and decreased 1.85% with placebo (P = 0.004).
 Patients receiving placebo had significant decreases in spine density (P = 0.0007) and total body calcium (P = 0.0004).

 A protocol of in vivo immune selection has been used to isolate a variant of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV)-induced tumor MBL-2.
 Characterization of the tumor variant indicated that selection resulted in the isolation of a cell which is incapable of producing infectious virus and no longer capable of synthesizing viral proteins.
 Although the failure to express viral Ag has rendered the variant tumor cells resistant to lysis by CTL specific for MuLV viral Ag, the variant tumor cells retained their susceptibility to lysis by CTL which appear to be directed against an MuLV-induced tumor-associated Ag.
 The data indicate that the expression of nonviral tumor-associated Ag by MBL-2 is not dependent upon continued viral gene expression.

"Progression through the cell cycle: an overview.
 Tissues in adults can be maintained at constant mass or they can increase or decrease in size because of imbalances of synthetic and degradative processes acting at the cellular and molecular levels.
 Some size changes are caused by physiologic conditions to which the tissue must adjust.
 Alternatively, the balance may be distorted in favor of net tissue increase in pathologic situations such as cancer.
 Strict regulatory mechanisms are required to keep proliferation responsive to the organism's needs; these mechanisms may be defective in disease.
 Net tissue proliferation requires repeated rounds of cell duplication in excess of that necessary to counterbalance cell death.
 Duplication of a cell requires a net doubling of its every molecule and structure.
 The myriad of molecular events required for cell proliferation such as DNA duplication and its partitioning at mitosis are tightly regulated in normal cells.
 One may conceive of two classes of molecules: those required for ""housekeeping,"" which constitute the cell's structural and functional machinery, and those such as growth factors, their receptors, and second messengers involved in signal transduction responsible for regulating the activities of the housekeeping molecules.
 These molecular events and the cascade of processes that control them can be organized within the sequence of the cell cycle.
 In this brief overview, we illustrate these issues with a few examples taken from very recent discoveries of novel proteins that appear to have major regulatory roles.
 Most of these results have been obtained with mammalian fibroblasts, but some have originated with discoveries made using two very different yeasts.

"Age-related changes in membrane fluidity of erythrocytes in essential hypertension.
 In the present study, age- and calcium-related changes in the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes were examined in patients with essential hypertension by use of electron spin resonance method (ESR).
 The erythrocytes were obtained from patients with essential hypertension.
 We examined the ESR spectra for a fatty acid spin label agent (5-nitroxy stearate) incorporated into the erythrocyte membranes.
 The values of outer hyperfine splitting and order parameter (S) were significantly higher in subjects with essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects.
 This finding indicates that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes was lower in essential hypertension.
 Calcium-loading of erythrocytes with the Ca-ionophore A23187 decreased the membrane fluidity (S value was increased) more strongly in essential hypertension than in the normotensive subjects.
 Furthermore, this Ca-induced change in membrane fluidity was significantly correlated with age in essential hypertension.
 These results demonstrate that the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes is markedly decreased by calcium, especially in essential hypertension in older patients.
 This suggests an increased calcium-sensitivity of cell membranes in the aged hypertensive patient.

"Predicting the need for hospitalization in children with acute asthma.
 In an attempt to identify factors which influence the decision of physicians to admit patients with acute asthma to the hospital, we studied prospectively 200 children (age 5.6 +/- 3.1 years, mean +/- SD) presenting to our emergency room with acute asthma.
 The children were assessed on arrival, and on disposition from the Emergency Room by one of the investigators.
 After obtaining historic data, a clinical score was assigned, and oxygen saturation and pulmonary function were measured.
 Of the 134 (67 percent) children who were discharged home from the Emergency Room, five returned within seven days and one was subsequently admitted.
 The clinical score on disposition was the sole variable found to best predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 73 percent, specificity 95 percent).
 Of the variables obtained at presentation, the resulting decision tree found the clinical score to predict the decision for hospitalization (sensitivity 79 percent, specificity 75 percent).
 When the individual components of the clinical score were analyzed, the degree of dyspnea, as assessed by the investigator, was chosen as the rule to predict the hospitalization decision (sensitivity 88 percent, specificity 71 percent).
 We conclude that the decision with respect to the need for hospitalization in acute childhood asthma, is in practice based mainly on careful clinical evaluation.
 Pulmonary function and SaO2 measurements, although helpful adjuncts in the assessment of acute asthma, do not appear to contribute to the identification of patients who need hospital admission.

"Richner-Hanhart's syndrome. Electron microscopic study of the skin lesion.
 The plantar hyperkeratotic skin lesion in a case of Richner-Hanhart's syndrome was investigated using ultrastructural examination.
 Light microscopic examination showed remarkable hyperkeratosis and some aberrant keratinocytes with multiple nuclei.
 On ultrastructural examination, some abnormal structures were seen in the affected keratinocytes: aggregations of tonofilaments and intracytoplasmic inclusions.
 The inclusions were needle shaped and were considered to be ""crystal ghosts,"" presumably of tyrosine.
 The formation of tyrosine crystalline inclusions seems to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the cutaneous lesions in Richner-Hanhart's syndrome.

"Effects of cyclophosphamide on the pathogenesis of cytomegalovirus-induced labyrinthitis.
 Cyclophosphamide was used in this study to define the contribution of the inflammatory response relative to direct cytopathic effects of guinea pig cytomegalovirus (GPCMV) in inducing sensorineural hearing loss in the guinea pig.
 The eighth nerve compound action potential (CAP) threshold on day 7 after inoculation of GPCMV into the scala tympani was an average of 35 dB greater for control animals than for those that were immunosuppressed with daily intraperitoneal injections of cyclophosphamide (20 mg/kg body weight).
 The amount of GPCMV antigen in the cochlea, detected immunohistochemically did not correlate with the CAP threshold.
 However, the greater the inflammatory response to GPCMV in the cochlea, the higher the CAP threshold and thus the greater the hearing loss.
 This study demonstrates that the inflammatory response to GPCMV may be more important than direct cytopathic effects of the virus in producing sensorineural hearing loss in GPCMV-induced labyrinthitis.

"A method for the determination of UVA protection for normal skin.
 Although the UVB portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (290 to 320 nm) is responsible for most of the harmful effects of sunlight on the skin, wavelengths in the UVA region also contribute to photodamage.
 A simple and rapid clinical test, the sun protection factor determination, is available to assess the sunburn protective effect of a sunscreen, primarily a UVB effect.
 However, no practical test has been proposed to measure a sunscreen's UVA protection.
 We described a method for the calculation of UVA protection in normal subjects.
 The determination of UVA protection involves three steps: (1) the UV absorbance spectrum of the sunscreen on skin is determined spectrophotometrically; (2) a convolution spectrum is calculated by multiplying the solar spectrum with the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage UV Hazard Spectrum; and (3) the sunscreen transmission spectrum is then incorporated into the convolution spectrum to obtain the UVA effectiveness ratio, which can be expressed as the UVA protection percentage.
 Because the UVA protection percentage value is based both on normal erythemic risk and on standard sunlight, the protection for any product can be easily measured.
 The procedure is simple, and values generated can be reproduced in other laboratories.

"Reappraisal of thyroxine treatment in primary hypothyroidism.
 The optimum daily dose of thyroxine was calculated for 13 children aged 3-16 years with primary hypothyroidism by titrating their doses at monthly intervals.
 The condition of the thyroid was assessed by sensitive assay of thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, as well as measurement of total and free thyroid hormone concentrations and systolic time interval ratios.
 Serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentration was found to be the most responsive to small changes in thyroxine.
 The calculated optimum daily replacement dose of thyroxine (102 micrograms/m2 or 3.5 micrograms/kg) was fractionally lower than that previously recommended, and was more closely related to surface area (coefficient of variation 8.2%) than to body weight (coefficient of variation 16.2%).
 Our results suggest that though monthly may be the optimal time interval for increases in the dose of thyroxine, any reduction in the dose should be made more gradually.

"The influence of joint line position on knee stability after condylar knee arthroplasty.
 Using a special knee-testing device, ten knees obtained at autopsy were subjected to varus-valgus, anterior-posterior, and flexion-rotation analysis in the intact state and after total knee arthroplasty.
 The ten knees showed no significant change in stability after knee replacement when the joint line was maintained in its natural position.
 When the femoral component was repositioned 5 mm proximally and 5 mm anteriorly, a significant increase in laxity occurred during midflexion.
 When the joint line was shifted 5 mm distal and 5 mm posterior to its anatomic location, significant tightening occurred in midrange of motion.
 Coupled rotation of the tibia with knee flexion was decreased after surgery in all knees with no specific relationship to joint line position.
 Coupled rotation with varus-valgus testing, however, remained within the normal range through the first 30 degrees of flexion only when the joint line was restored to its normal anatomic position.
 Stability in condylar knee arthroplasty is in part dependent on position of the joint line.
 Surgical techniques that rely on restoring the flexion and extension gap without regard to joint line position may result in alteration of varus-valgus or anterior-posterior displacement in midrange flexion.

"Chronic nightly tidal peritoneal dialysis.
 Nightly tidal peritoneal dialysis (NTPD) is a technique in which, after an initial fill of the peritoneal cavity, only a portion of dialysate is rapidly cycled.
 Five anuric, stable, PD patients entered a 4 month study to determine the NTPD session length necessary for clinically adequate dialysis and creatinine clearance similar to those on four daily 2 L CAPD exchanges.
 NTPD was performed using a modified PAC-X-2 cycler, with the drain phase regulated by a target volume.
 One patient completed 3.5 months of study, one 4 months, three 6 months, and one patient each continued on NTPD for 13, 14, and 32 months.
 The mean NTPD session time was 9 hr 24 min (range 8 hr 35 min to 9 hr 55 min) at the end of 4 months.
 All patients had clinically adequate dialysis.
 Three patients preferred NTPD over CAPD, particularly because of an empty abdomen during the daytime.
 One patient required an increase in NTPD time, and an addition of one daytime exchange, because of low creatinine clearance.
 In conclusion, NTPD provides weekly creatinine clearances comparable to CAPD, with an acceptable duration of nightly dialysis sessions in most anuric patients.
 A new PD machine providing inexpensive dialysis solution in large quantities, as well as safe and false alarm free dialysis sessions, is needed for practical NTPD implementation.

"Aggressive oral refeeding in hospitalized patients.
 Malnutrition is an important clinical condition leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
 This report describes an aggressive oral refeeding program of high-caloric foods, which was instituted in severely anorectic patients because of their refusal to eat meals or supplements.
 After ascertaining a patient's favorite sweet, hospital personnel and family collaborated in providing the food.
 Frequently, sweets were the patient's only intake for weeks.
 We saw a gradual return of appetite, inclusion of other foods in the diet, and overall clinical improvement in comorbid conditions.
 These cases suggest that aggressive oral refeeding with high-caloric foods is an underutilized therapy for multiply impaired elderly patients.

"Brain glucose metabolism in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a study in Pima Indians using positron emission tomography during hyperinsulinemia with euglycemic glucose clamp.
 To determine whether insulin or noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus affects brain glucose metabolism, brain glucose utilization was studied in the basal state and during hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps in nondiabetic and diabetic Pima Indians by positron emission tomography with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG).
 Glucose utilization in 75 brain areas was determined by analysis of single scans and by least squares estimation of the rate parameters for the FDG model; these data were compared to results in normal caucasian volunteers.
 No effect of ethnicity or diabetic status on brain glucose utilization was observed.
 During the hyperinsulinemic clamps (mean insulin, 11,708 +/- 3,026 pmol/L), clearance of 18FDG from blood was accelerated, and accumulation of brain radioactivity was reduced.
 However, glucose utilization by the brain was identical to results during sham glucose clamps (mean insulin, 204 +/- 56 pmol/L) performed in the same patients.
 During the studies with hyperinsulinemia, k4 (representing loss of tissue radioactivity) was increased in most brain areas (mean increase, 0.0031 +/- 0.0018 min-1; P less than 0.02).
 The possible mechanisms for this effect are multiple, and the physiological significance, if any, is unknown.
 Further studies of the effects of insulin on brain glucose metabolism are needed.

"Sexually transmitted diseases and human immunodeficiency virus infection among women with pelvic inflammatory disease.
 Both human immunodeficiency virus infections and pelvic inflammatory diseases are sexually acquired illnesses of great consequence to women.
 This study was undertaken to determine if women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, were at high risk to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus and if human immunodeficiency virus infections altered their hospital course.
 One hundred ten women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease in Brooklyn (in a hospital in which 2% of parturients are human immunodeficiency virus seropositive) agreed to human immunodeficiency virus testing; 15 (13.6%) were found to be seropositive.
 Seropositive women were significantly more likely to have an admission white blood cell count less than 10,000/mm3 (p = 0.001).
 Human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity was not associated with a higher frequency of other sexually transmitted diseases although there was a trend toward more cases of syphilis among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
 Similarly, although there was no significant difference in rates of operative intervention (26.6% among seropositive and 8.4% among seronegative; p = 0.058), there was a trend toward more surgery among those who were human immunodeficiency virus infected.
 Women hospitalized with pelvic inflammatory disease, in a community endemic for human immunodeficiency virus, are at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 More research is needed to verify a trend toward more refractory infections among human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.

"Long-term echocardiographic follow-up of patients with a tricuspid bioprosthesis.
 To clarify the long-term results of bioprosthetic valve function in the tricuspid position, 29 consecutive patients who underwent tricuspid valve replacement (TVR) were evaluated.
 There were 20 girls/women and 9 boys/men, with ages ranging from 6 to 61 years (mean 41.4 years).
 The bioprosthetic valves included Hancock in 2, and Carpentier-Edwards in 27.
 The follow-up period ranged from 32 to 145 months (mean 89 months).
 Regurgitant flow of the tricuspid bioprosthesis was studied by color Doppler echocardiography.
 Peak velocity (Vp) and pressure half time (PHT) were measured by continuous wave Doppler echocardiography.
 Operative mortality was 13.7% (4/29), with the actuarial survival rate, including operative deaths, 75% at 10 years.
 Valve thrombosis developed in one patient 4 years after TVR.
 Color Doppler showed regurgitation in 7 of the 20 patients who were completely followed up, but they were all asymptomatic and required no special intervention.
 Cusp tear or calcification requiring reoperation was not observed in this study, including 8 patients younger than 35 years of age.
 The Vp was significantly slower, and PHT was significantly prolonged, in the tricuspid rather than the mitral position.
 These data demonstrate that bioprosthetic valves in the tricuspid position can be used safely.
 Doppler examination should be performed taking these different flow dynamics into account.

"Results of conservative surgery and radiation therapy for breast cancer.
 For stage I or II breast cancer, conservative surgery and radiation therapy are as effective as modified radical or radical mastectomy.
 In most cases, cosmetic considerations and the availability of therapy are the primary concerns.
 The extent of a surgical resection less than a mastectomy has not been a subject of a randomized trial and is controversial.
 It appears that removal of a quadrant of the breast for small lesions is safe but excessive.
 Using histologic findings in the biopsy as a guide, it may be possible to limit the breast resection to gross tumor removal for most patients while using wider resections for patients with an extensive intraductal component or for invasive lobular carcinoma.
 It also appears that excluding patients from breast conservation on the basis of positive margins on the first attempt at tumor excision may be unnecessarily restrictive.
 Although patients with an extensive intraductal component or invasive lobular carcinoma should have negative margins, it appears that a patient with predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma can be treated without re-excision if all gross tumor has been resected and there is no reason to suspect extensive microscopic disease.
 Patients with indeterminate margins should have a re-excision.
 Axillary dissection provides prognostic information and prevents progression of the disease within the axilla.
 Axillary dissections limited to level I will accurately identify a substantial number of patients who have pathologically positive but clinically negative nodes.
 When combined with radiation therapy to the axilla, a level I dissection results in a limited number of patients with progressive axillary disease.
 Patients with pathologically positive axillas and patients at particularly high risk for systemic disease because of the extent of axillary node involvement can be identified by dissections of levels I and II.
 Radiation therapy can be avoided safely in patients who have pathologically negative axillas by level I and II dissection.
 There appears to be no advantage to routine dissection of level III lymph nodes.
 Lymphedema of the arm and breast increases with more extensive dissections and with radiation therapy.

"Maximal O2 uptake of in situ dog muscle during acute hypoxemia with constant perfusion.
 We investigated the relationships among maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), effluent venous PO2 (PvO2), and calculated mean capillary PO2 (PCO2) in isolated dog gastrocnemius in situ as arterial PO2 (PaO2) was progressively reduced with muscle blood flow held constant.
 The hypothesis that VO2max is determined in part by peripheral tissue O2 diffusion predicts proportional declines in VO2max and PCO2 if the diffusing capacity of the muscle remains constant.
 The inspired O2 fraction was altered in each of six dogs to produce four different levels of PaO2 [22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 1, 38 +/- 1, and 79 +/- 4 (SE) Torr].
 Muscle blood flow, with the circulation isolated, was held constant at 122 +/- 15 ml.100 g-1.min-1 while the muscle worked maximally (isometric twitches at 5-7 Hz) at each of the four different values of PaO2.
 Arterial and venous samples were taken to measure lactate, pH, PO2, PCO2, and muscle VO2.
 PCO2 was calculated using Fick's law of diffusion and a Bohr integration procedure.
 VO2max fell progressively (P less than 0.01) with decreasing PaO2.
 The decline in VO2max was proportional (R = 0.99) to the fall in both muscle PvO2 and calculated PCO2 while the calculated muscle diffusing capacity was not different among the four conditions.
 Fatigue developed more rapidly with lower PaO2, although lactate output from the muscle was not different among conditions.
 These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to O2 diffusion in the peripheral tissue may be a principal determinant of VO2max.

"An inconsistent relationship between insulin and blood pressure in three Pacific island populations.
 The evidence linking insulin to blood pressure is controversial, and results for groups similarly categorized by body mass, glucose tolerance and hypertensive status are often contradictory.
 We have investigated the relationship in three population-based samples of Micronesian (Nauru), Polynesian (Western Samoa) and Melanesian (New Caledonia) Pacific islanders, who are known to be susceptible to obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), hyperinsulinaemia and hypertension.
 After controlling for age and body mass index (BMI), mean fasting and 2-hr (post 75 g glucose) insulin levels were not significantly different between hypertensive and non-hypertensive subjects, in any population or glucose tolerance sub-group, excepting 2-hr insulin in New Caledonians with normal glucose tolerance.
 Similarly, there were no strong trends for a higher prevalence of hypertension amongst those with insulin levels in the upper quartile of the distribution of each population, although it was apparent in some BMI/glucose tolerance sub-groups of two populations.
 Multiple linear regression analyses also showed an inconsistent and where present, weak, independent association between insulin and blood pressure in models predicting both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
 We therefore conclude that the hypothesis implicating insulin as a major determinant of blood pressure and as the pathophysiological link between obesity, NIDDM and hypertension is not strongly supported either by the literature or the present data.

 Traumatic rupture of the thoracic aorta is increasing in incidence and remains a highly lethal injury.
 The morbidity associated with this injury also remains high.
 We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients admitted to our emergency department with ruptured thoracic aortas during a 15-year period to determine the reason for this persistently high morbidity and mortality and to identify any factors that might improve the outcome.
 We found that patients who are in unstable condition on arrival in the emergency department or who become unstable before reaching the operating room are not likely to survive.
 Patients who are injured in automobile accidents have a greater chance of survival than do those injured in motorcycle accidents or car-pedestrian accidents.
 Patients who are in hemodynamically stable condition after aortic injury survive only if diagnosis and treatment are prompt.
 Major complications of repair following thoracic aortic injury relate primarily to the length of cross-clamp time, and every effort should be devoted to keeping the cross-clamp time less than 30 minutes.

 During the subsequent 41-month follow-up (range 10 to 50 months), the yearly cardiac mortality rate was 1.3% in patients with LVH, 2.9% in patients with VPBs, and 8.0% in patients with LVH plus VPBs but only 0.6% when none of these factors was present (p less than 0.05 chi 2 test).

 No recombinants were observed between D10S94 and D10Z1 or MEN2A.
 D10S94 maps in proximal 10q11.2 very near to MEN2A.
 There are three possible orders for the six loci that we investigated from the centromeric region of chromosome 10.
 At present the genetic data do not allow us to order MEN2A with respect to D10Z1 and D10S94.
 The three possible orders are FNRB-D10Z1-D10S94-MEN2A-RBP3-D10S15, FNRB-D10Z1-MEN2A-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15, and FNRB-MEN2A-D10Z1-D10S94-RBP3-D10S15.

"Isolation of a novel tumor protein that induces resistance to natural killer cell lysis.
 The human metastatic tumor cell line CAP-2, produces a soluble factor that induces resistance to NK lysis of K-562 susceptible leukemia cell line, and does not inhibit the cytotoxic capacity of effector cells.
 The use of sequential HPLC, hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and reverse phase chromatography, coupled with cytotoxic assays, resulted in the isolation and separation to homogeneity of a novel protein responsible for this biologic activity.
 Size estimation studies based on TSK HPLC columns showed that this protein has a mass of 8 to 12 kDa.
 The amino acid composition analysis of the CAP-2 protein calculated from HPLC chromatograms shows that this protein contains around 108 amino acids.
 Subsequent gas phase sequence analysis, however, was hampered because the N terminus of this protein was blocked and therefore unsuitable for sequencing by Edman degradation.
 The functional studies showed that the NK lysis-resistance activity of the CAP-2 protein is mediated by interaction with and nonspecific binding to NK target cells.
 The lymphokine-activated killer and macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity and mitogen-induced proliferation is not affected.
 Unexpectedly, the CAP-2 protein appears to be mitogenic to its own cell line.
 Thus, the induction of NK lysis-resistance and the mitogenic activity showed by CAP-2 protein could contribute to the tumor growth and metastatic establishment.

 Patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias, nodal rhythm ventricular bradyarrhythmias, and ventricular rapid rhythms had significantly (p less than .01) increased mortality rates (40%, 44%, 77%, and 51%, respectively) when compared with patients without arrhythmias (35%).
 The relative risk of dying (RRD) of these clinical groups was increased by 1.16, 1.27, 2.20, and 1.47, respectively.
 Patients with cardiorespiratory precipitating disease and any arrhythmia except atrial bradyarrhythmia had a mortality rate between 32% and 74%, significantly (p less than .05) different from that of patients within the same clinical groups without arrhythmias.

 The literature suggests that prior to 1981, the only groups concerned with sexual history taking were urologists, psychiatrists, and gynecologists.

"Intraoperative decision making during thyroid surgery based on the results of preoperative needle biopsy and frozen section.
 Prognostic factors in well-differentiated thyroid cancer are age of the patient and grade, size, distant metastasis, and extracapsular spread of the disease.
 However, the surgeon is often not sure about the pathologic diagnosis of thyroid nodules.
 The accuracy of preoperative studies, such as ultrasonography and thyroid scanning, is limited.
 The most cost-effective test is fine-needle aspiration, the accuracy of which exceeds 80% in most series.
 However, a large group of nodules exist for which aspiration cytologic studies are considered to be either suspicious or indeterminate.
 The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy may be difficult in these patients.
 Intraoperative frozen section may help the surgeon to distinguish benign from malignant lesions, but as in fine-needle aspiration, the major problem is the distinction between follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma.
 The frozen section diagnosis of follicular adenoma was changed to follicular carcinoma in one third of the cases (13 of 38 cases).
 The decision about the extent of thyroidectomy in patients with follicular adenomas was based on other prognostic factors, such as age and sex of the patient and the size of the nodule.
 The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis was 95%.
 Our experience suggests that decisions regarding the extent of thyroidectomy can best be made by preoperative fine-needle aspiration with confirmation by frozen section diagnosis in equivocal cases.

"Parathyroid hormone-like peptide in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells.
 Mesothelioma has not been commonly reported as a cause of hypercalcemia of malignancy.
 We have studied a patient with malignant mesothelioma and hypercalcemia in association with elevated plasma concentrations of parathyroid hormone-like peptide (PLP).
 Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor and seven of eight other mesotheliomas that were not associated with hypercalcemia revealed the presence of PLP cytoplasmic immunopositivity.
 PLP immunopositivity was also detected in normal and reactive mesothelial cells.
 The results of these studies suggest that PLP immunoreactivity is common in normal and neoplastic mesothelial cells and raises the possibility that PLP production may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypercalcemia associated with mesothelioma.

"Clinical significance of antibodies to a 68 kDa U1RNP polypeptide in connective tissue disease.
 In a series of 163 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or systemic sclerosis and/or mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), the presence of antibodies to a 68 kDa U1RNP associated polypeptide was more predictive for SLE (88%) than for MCTD (38-68%) using 3 different sets of proposed criteria for the latter condition.
 In all but one case studied serially the immunoblotting profile remained constant.
 In SLE recognition of the 68 kDa polypeptide identified a subset with increased vasoreactivity with Raynaud's phenomenon (96%, p less than 0.001) and swollen fingers (68%, p less than 0.001) whereas recognition of a 47 kDa La (SSB) polypeptide was associated with photosensitivity (72%, p less than 0.02), less renal involvement (p less than 0.05) and an older age of disease onset (46.6 years +/- 18.3 SD, p less than 0.002).

"Late-onset ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency in male patients [published erratum appears in J Pediatr 1991 Feb;118(2):326]
 We report on 21 male patients who presented after 28 days of age with ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, which we define as late-onset OTC deficiency.
 These patients appeared normal at birth, but irritability, vomiting, and lethargy, which were often episodic, later developed.
 The age at presentation ranged from 2 months to 44 years.
 Biochemical testing revealed hyperammonemia, hyperglutaminemia, hypocitrullinemia, increased urinary orotate excretion, and decreased liver OTC activity measured in vitro, which ranged from 0% to 15% of normal.
 Male patients who were older at presentation had a somewhat different pattern of presenting symptoms and were more likely to die.
 These data illustrate the phenotypic variability of OTC deficiency.
 Unexplained episodes of repetitive or protracted vomiting in association with progressive alterations in behavior or neurologic findings should suggest the diagnosis of a urea cycle defect (or another symptomatic inborn error of metabolism), regardless of the age or medical history of the patient.

"Efficacy of ibopamine in the treatment of heart failure.
 Loss of myocardial contractility, reflexly enhanced vasoconstriction, and neuroendocrine excitation are the pathophysiologic hallmarks of low-output heart failure.
 Drugs that counter both consequences afford considerable therapeutic potential in retarding and perhaps even in staying the consequences of the syndrome.
 Ibopamine possesses such potential through its unique ability to stimulate both dopaminergic- and beta-adrenoreceptors in the heart and circulatory system.
 Stimulation of dopaminergic- receptors and beta 2-adrenoreceptors results in vasodilatation in all regional vascular territories.
 beta 2-Adrenoreceptor agonist activity also affords mild positive inotropic activity in the heart, whereas stimulation of presynaptic dopaminergic- receptors (DA2) attenuates the increased sympathetic neural outflow.
 The drug also suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in addition to having a direct natriuretic activity.
 The pharmacodynamic effects of ibopamine, exerted through its metabolite epinine, are translated into measurable therapeutic benefits in patients with chronic heart failure.
 The increase in peripheral blood flow induced in all regional vascular territories, including the kidneys, is associated with increased cardiac output and stroke volume and reduction in left ventricular pressure work, wall stress, and myocardial oxygen consumption.
 Plasma norepinephrine, angiotensin, and aldosterone are also reduced, and renal sodium excretion is enhanced.
 These hemodynamic and neuroendocrine activities, which are not subject to tolerance during sustained administration of the drug, are accompanied by clinically significant improvement in symptoms, exercise tolerance, and the New York Heart Association classification of disability.
 More important, no proarrhythmic effects have been observed during sustained treatment, and the minimal side effects observed during long-term treatment enhance the safety profile of the drug.

"Defective expression of p70/75 interleukin 2 receptor in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a possible defect in the process of increased intracellular calcium leading to p70/75 expression.
 Phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) showed hyporesponsiveness to interleukin 2 (IL-2) and expressed less p70/75 IL-2R than healthy controls.
 Ionomycine (IM, calcium ionophore) which selectively upregulated p70/75 expression, induced less p70/75 in patients with SLE than in healthy controls.
 However, intracellular calcium levels of T cells from patients with SLE increased as much as those from healthy controls, when T cells were stimulated by IM or PHA.
 Our results suggest that an impaired expression of p70/75 IL-2R in T cells from patients with SLE is not due to a defective calcium influx but to the events after the rise of calcium levels.

"Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis. The influence of the torn and detached acetabular labrum.
 We assessed the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy in 64 hips with early osteoarthritis in terms of acetabular labral detachment detected pre-operatively by arthrography.
 At an average follow-up of four years, assessment by the Merle d'Aubigne score showed 83% excellent or good results.
 These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra.
 Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results.
 Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure.

"Bretylium tosylate versus lidocaine in experimental cardiac arrest 
 Bretylium tosylate has been shown effective in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation and in the prevention of its recurrence.
 However, lidocaine is generally preferred because bretylium could have adverse hemodynamic effects related to its antiadrenergic action.
 To explore further the differences between these two antiarrhythmic agents, the authors compared the effects of bretylium, lidocaine, and saline on a standardized dog model of ventricular fibrillation followed by electromechanical dissociation (EMD).
 The protocol included three successive episodes of cardiac arrest in each animal.
 Three minutes before each episode of ventricular fibrillation, 5 mg/kg of bretylium tosylate (n = 11), 1 mg/kg of lidocaine (n = 9) or saline (n = 12) were administered blindly.
 There was no difference in the duration of cardiac arrest (bretylium, 8 min 18 sec; lidocaine, 7 min 54 sec; saline, 8 min 20 sec) or the total doses of epinephrine required to resuscitate the animals.
 Both bretylium and lidocaine appeared to preserve cardiac function 5 minutes after recovery, as stroke volume increased from 17.8 +/- 6.7 to 18.7 +/- 6.7 mL (NS) after bretylium and from 17.7 +/- 7.7 to 19.0 +/- 7.0 mL (NS) after lidocaine, but decreased from 19.0 +/- 5.3 to 14.6 +/- 6.0 mL (P less than .05) after saline.
 During the first 10 minutes of EMD, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia recurred in 4 dogs treated with lidocaine, 3 dogs treated with saline, but no dog treated with bretylium (P less than .05 between bretylium and saline).

"The effect of repetitive exercise on airway temperatures 
 To determine if a relationship exists between intra-airway thermal events and the reduction in pulmonary mechanics that occur in asthmatics when they perform repetitive exercise, we recorded intrathoracic airstream temperatures in seven subjects during and after two identical bouts of cycle ergometry performed 30 min apart.
 From these data, global and regional thermal energy exchanges were calculated.
 Inspired air conditions, work loads, and minute ventilations were held constant for both trials.
 Pulmonary mechanics were measured prior to and serially after each challenge.
 As expected, the second provocation produced a smaller response than did the first.
 In association with these mechanical changes, the second challenge also produced less airway cooling and slower rewarming in the central airways.
 Hence, repetitive exercise trials performed over short intervals attenuate the essential thermal gradients necessary to produce obstruction.
 To the extent that these differences in intra-airway temperature reflect changes in perfusion, our data raise the possibility that the responsivity of the bronchial microcirculation of asthmatics may be altered by repetitive exercise.

"Myotonic dystrophy: quantification of muscle weakness and myotonia and the effect of amitriptyline and exercise.
 The purpose of this study was to quantify the degree of muscle weakness and myotonia in 12 patients with myotonic dystrophy (MD), and to quantitatively determine the effects of a four- to six-month therapeutic trial of amitriptyline.
 Patients had exercised with weights for one or more years.
 Some had shown initial improvement in muscle strength, but had reached a plateau; others had not improved when the study began.
 Muscle weakness was quantified by comparing the five-second maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in newtons (N) per kg (body weight) of 12 patients and 20 healthy subjects.
 Knee extensor, elbow flexor, and first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles were compared.
 Myotonia was quantified by measuring relaxation times (RTs) at the end of the five-second MVC produced by FDI, as the time taken for the MVC to decrease by 50% and 75% (referred to as 1/2 and 3/4RT).
 The results were as follows: (1) the mean muscle strength of each of the three muscles of the patients was significantly (p less than .001) reduced compared with healthy subjects; and (2) 1/2 and 3/4RT means of the patients (vs healthy subjects) were significantly prolonged (p less than .01).
 Eight of the patients participated in a therapeutic trial of amitriptyline.
 Therapeutic effects were quantified by measuring muscle strength, 1/2 and 3/4RT, and percent change in evoked muscle action potential (MAP) from the FDI muscle after a ten-second MVC, to determine change in excitability.
 Mean muscle strength of FDI improved from .27 to .33N/kg, (p less than .05).

"Piezoelectric lithotripsy: stone disintegration and follow-up results in patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones.
 One hundred symptomatic patients with radiolucent gallbladder stones were treated with a new piezoelectric lithotripter and oral chemolitholytic agents.
 Stone disintegration was achieved in 99 of these patients (99%) with a mean (+/- SD) maximum fragment size of 5.1 +/- 4.1 mm.
 Significant differences were found when the mean (+/- SD) fragment sizes of single stones less than or equal to 20 mm (4.2 +/- 2.5 mm) were compared with those of single stones greater than 20 mm (5.8 +/- 3.4 mm; P less than 0.05) and multiple stones (6.2 +/- 3.8 mm; P less than 0.05), respectively.
 None of the patients required anesthesia, analgesics, or sedatives before or during the treatment.
 The stone-free rates for all patients followed up for up to 4-12 months (mean +/- SD, 10.7 +/- 2.9 months) were 18% (1 month), 25% (2 months), 38% (4 months), 52% (8 months), and 67% (12 months).
 Partly significant differences were obtained in stone-free rates for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm) compared with larger stones (greater than 20 mm) and multiple stones (P less than 0.05), respectively.
 Serious adverse reactions (i.e., cholestasis and pancreatitis) were observed in only 3 patients (3%).
 These conditions were induced by fragment impaction in the common bile duct.
 In 2 of these patients, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy was required.
 It is concluded that piezoelectrically generated shock waves are suitable for the effective and safe disintegration of gallbladder stones in humans.
 The anesthesia-free and analgesia-free shock-wave application opens up the possibility to perform biliary lithotripsy as an outpatient procedure.
 The stone-free rate achieved in combination with oral bile acids is most promising for single stones (less than or equal to 20 mm).

"Predictive value of lipoprotein (a) and other serum lipoproteins in the angiographic diagnosis of coronary artery disease.
 To determine the relation among lipids in predicting coronary artery disease (CAD), 213 patients undergoing diagnostic angiography for suspected CAD were prospectively studied.
 Twenty-one patients had normal coronary arteries and 192 had CAD in 1 to 3 arteries at arteriography with measurements obtained with digital calipers.
 Lipoproteins were measured and lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] was also assayed in a subset of 98 patients with CAD.
 Statistical analysis was performed using uni- and multivariate techniques to test the association among age, gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, family history, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and apo B, ratio of apo A-I to apo B, and ratio of HDL cholesterol to total cholesterol, to Lp(a) and to CAD.
 All factors except gender, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking were univariate predictors of CAD.
 Multivariate predictors were, in decreasing order of significance, family history, age, HDL/total cholesterol ratio and apo B.
 When Lp(a) was included, multivariate predictors were age, family history, apo B and Lp(a), in that order.
 Lipid parameters alone showed that the HDL/total cholesterol ratio and that Lp(a) provide the best predictive tests for the detection of CAD in this referral population and may ultimately become important screening tests for CAD.

"Studies of salt intake in hypertension. What can epidemiology teach us?
 It has been suggested that small changes in population blood pressure will have a major impact upon the incidence of cardiovascular disease caused by blood pressure elevation.
 Early reports indicated a close correlation between intercultural differences in salt intake and blood pressure.
 Before such epidemiological associations can be translated into population advice, certain conditions have to be met.
 The association has to be validated scientifically, and persuasive evidence has to be produced that the relationship is causal and reversible by changes in salt intake.
 Further, risk-benefit analysis should indicate that net harm is unlikely.
 Finally it has to be demonstrated that the population measures being advocated will produce an adequate change in dietary salt intake.
 The small individual effects upon blood pressure being examined, and the prevailing changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality suggest that data will always fall short of the ideal and therefore that extrapolation will always be necessary.
 Nevertheless, a review of the present evidence indicates the inadequacies of the available data as a basis for population advice.

"Persistent right umbilical vein: an ominous prenatal finding?
 The persistence of a right umbilical vein is an uncommon finding, with only a dozen cases reported since 1826.
 The persistent right umbilical vein may replace the normal left umbilical vein or be supernumerary.
 The anomaly is associated with numerous and occasionally lethal malformations.
 In this series, only three of six fetuses (and another two in the literature) had no associated anomalies.
 All the others had a variety of associated lesions ranging from minor to lethal.
 The appearance at ultrasound is easy to recognize: The intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein is lateral to the gallbladder, and the portal vein curves toward the stomach, instead of parallel to it.
 Since the recognition of the persistent right umbilical vein is simple and does not require additional scanning (it is visible in the section used to measure the abdominal perimeter), the author suggests using it as an indicator for more in-depth scanning.

"Effect of age on the efficacy of blood pressure treatment strategies.
 To study whether the proportion of excess cardiovascular events attributable to various levels of systolic blood pressure varies with age, we calculated the population-attributable risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), and stroke incidence due to systolic blood pressure in men and women 45 years of age or older in the United States during 1980.
 Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort.
 We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events.
 At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg).
 With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons.
 The pattern is similar for men and women.
 The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach.

"Effect of dosage and timing of administration of naloxone on outcome in the rat ventral compression model of spinal cord injury.
 The effect of the dosage and timing of administration of naloxone after spinal cord injury in rats via the ventral compression technique is presented.
 The rat ventral compression technique allows for a ventral compression of the spinal cord without the requirement of a previous laminectomy.
 It therefore facilitates the creation of an experimental lesion that is similar to that observed in the human clinicopathological situation.
 The first part of the two-part study presented herein involved the determination of the optimal dose of naloxone, administered intraperitoneally 45 minutes after the creation of the lesion.
 Of the groups studied (control group through 10.0 mg/kg group), 2.0 mg/kg of naloxone proved to be superior to both lesser and greater dosages.
 The second part of the study involved the administration of a 2.0 mg/kg dose of naloxone at varying intervals ranging from 10 minutes before lesioning to 24 hours after lesioning.
 A multiphasic response was again demonstrated, with an optimal time of administration occurring 45 minutes after the creation of the lesion.
 A significant effect was offered by a midrange dose of naloxone (2.0 mg/kg), administered at 45 minutes after injury (P less than 0.02 by analysis of variance and Duncan's multiple range test).
 These findings are discussed with respect to recent evidence regarding the effects of narcotic antagonists on both mu and kappa narcotic receptors.
 Past and future experiments must account for these responses to multiphasic dosage and timing of administration.

 We report induction of renal growth and injury in the intact rat kidney using a diet deficient in vitamin E and selenium.
 This diet was imposed in 3-wk-old male weanling rats, and after 9 wk, enhancement of growth, characterized by increased wet weight, dry weight, protein content, and DNA content appeared.
 Morphometric analyses revealed increased kidney volume, tubular epithelial volume, and mean glomerular volume.
 There were no differences in nephron number.
 The animals on the deficient diet displayed increased urinary protein excretion at 9 wk.
 Renal injury was also characterized by an interstitial cellular infiltrate and diminutions in glomerular filtration rate.
 Enhanced growth and injury were antedated by increased renal ammoniagenesis.
 The deficient diet did not induce metabolic acidosis, potassium depletion, glucose intolerance, or elevated plasma amino acid concentration.
 Enhancement of renal growth and ammoniagenesis by the deficient diet was not suppressible by chronic alkali therapy.
 Stimulation of renal growth could not be ascribed to increased intrarenal iron, induction of ornithine decarboxylase, or alterations in glomerular hemodynamics.
 Stimulation of renal ammoniagenesis by dietary deficiency of antioxidants is a novel finding, as is induction of growth and injury.
 We suggest that increased renal ammoniagenesis contributes to induction of renal growth and injury.

"Human basophils express interleukin-4 receptors.
 Interleukin-4 (IL-4), a multipotential lymphokine reputed to play an important role in the regulation of immune responses, interacts with a variety of hemopoietic target cells through specific cell surface membrane receptors.
 The present study was designed to investigate whether human basophils express IL-4 binding sites.
 For this purpose, basophils were enriched to homogeneity (93% and 98% purity, respectively) from the peripheral blood of two chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) donors using a cocktail of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and complement.
 Purified basophils bound 125I-radiolabeled recombinant human (rh) IL-4 in a specific manner.
 Quantitative binding studies and Scatchard plot analysis revealed the presence of a single class of high affinity IL-4 binding sites (280 +/- 40 sites per cell in donor 1 and 640 +/- 45 sites per cell in donor 2) with an apparent dissociation constant, kd, of 7.12 x 10(-11) +/- 2.29 x 10(-11) and 9.55 +/- 3.5 x 10(-11) mol/L, respectively.
 KU812-F, a human basophil precursor cell line, was found to express a single class of 810 to 1,500 high affinity IL-4 binding sites with a kd of 2.63 to 5.54 x 10(-10) mol/L.
 No change in the numbers or binding constants of IL-4 receptors was found after exposure of KU812-F cells to rhIL-3 (a potent activator of basophils) for 60 minutes.
 No effect of rhIL-4 on 3H-thymidine uptake, release or synthesis of histamine, or expression of basophil differentiation antigens (Bsp-1, CD11b, CD25, CD40, CD54) on primary human CGL basophils or KU812-F cells was observed.

"Neurodevelopmental performance of very-low-birth-weight infants with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage. Outcome at 5 to 6 years of age.
 The neurodevelopmental outcome of 38 very-low-birth-weight neonates (birth weight, less than 1501 g) was followed up prospectively from birth to 5 to 6 years of age to assess the neurodevelopmental sequelae of mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (grades I and II).
 All neonates were screened for periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage at 5 to 10 days of age.
 Eleven incurred a mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 1) and 27 had no periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage (group 2).
 Each of the infants was neurodevelopmentally normal at 1 to 2 years of age.
 The 38 children were matched by race, age, sex, and socioeconomic status with control children (group 3) who had been born at term.
 On outcome measurements at 5 to 6 years of age, groups 1 and 2 scored significantly lower than group 3 on the combined test measurements and on three of the four individual measurements.
 Group 1 scored significantly lower than group 2 on the combined test measurements only.
 These data indicate that very-low-birth-weight infants are at risk for learning problems.
 Although children with mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage did not demonstrate a significant deficit on individual test scores, the significant difference on the combined battery suggests that mild periventricular, intraventricular hemorrhage has an adverse effect on global performance.

"Use of molecular cloning methods to map the distribution of epitopes on topoisomerase I (Scl-70) recognized by sera of scleroderma patients.
 We report the initial molecular characterization of the autoimmune response against DNA topoisomerase I (topo I; Scl-70).
 Sera from 36 patients with scleroderma and 4 healthy control subjects were studied using 6 subcloned portions of topo I.
 Twenty-three sera recognized at least 2 independent epitopes on the molecule.
 Therefore, anti-topo I, like other non-organ-specific autoantibodies characterized to date, is polyclonal and multifocal.
 The cloned protein should prove suitable for sensitive early detection of anti-topo I in the clinical setting.

"A controlled trial of nebulized isoetharine in the prehospital treatment of acute asthma.
 Acute asthma is a potentially life-threatening disorder, recognizable to the prehospital care provider.
 While therapies are available to the prehospital care provider for treating acute asthma, no previous controlled studies have been performed demonstrating the treatment in the field is efficacious and safe.
 The authors conducted a controlled trial of the prehospital use of nebulized isoetharine in an urban emergency medical services system.
 Fifty-two patients with acute asthma were studied.
 Patients were initially evaluated with a peak flow meter.
 Half of the patients received isoetharine, while the control group received basic life support only.
 There was no difference in baseline values.
 Peak expiratory flow increased from 138 L/min to 148 L/min in the control group, while it increased from 149 L/min to 218 L/min in the treatment group (P less than .001).
 The authors conclude that paramedic treatment of acute asthma with nebulized isoetharine is effective in improving pulmonary function and clinical status during transport.

"The Patterns of Care Outcome Study for cancer of the uterine cervix. Results of the Second National Practice Survey.
 This report summarizes the outcome results of the Patterns of Care Study (PCS) of cancer of the uterine cervix from 565 patients treated in 1978.
 The 5-year survival with no evidence of disease was: Stage I, 74%; Stage II, 56%; and Stage III, 33%.
 The 5-year local in-field failure rate was: Stage I, 12%, Stage II, 27%; and Stage III, 51%.
 Extent of parametrial involvement, unilateral versus bilateral, may be important in determining survival and local failure.
 The four-year actuarial survival was 58% for unilateral involvement versus 47% for bilateral (P = 0.06), and the local failure rate was 32% for unilateral versus 45% for bilateral (P less than 0.05).
 When analyzed by stage, patients with Stage IIb disease with unilateral parametrial involvement showed a trend toward improved survival and decreased local failure compared with those with bilateral Stage IIb cancers (P = 0.1).
 The use of intracavitary irradiation significantly improved survival and reduced local failures.
 Furthermore, the number of intracavitary applications was important.
 When two or more intracavitary applications were used compared with one application, local in-field failure was significantly reduced, 29% versus 17% at 4 years (P less than 0.001), and four-year survival was improved, 60% versus 73% (P = 0.01).
 The four-year actuarial rate of major complications depended on the stage: Stage I, 8%; Stage II, 15%; and Stage III, 13%.
 There was a statistically significant increase in major complications in patients undergoing laparotomy for staging versus no laparotomy 23% versus 11% at 4 years (P less than or equal to 0.01) and a trend toward increased major complications in patients who were thin or had prior abdominal surgery.
 This study confirmed the stage-dependent outcome of treatment of cancer of the uterine cervix with radiation and indicated that further division of Stage IIb to indicate prognostic significance of unilateral or bilateral parametrial involvement may be warranted.
 This study also confirmed the importance of intracavitary radiation in optimizing control established by the 1973 PCS.
 It further suggests that where possible, two intracavitary insertions may yield better results than one insertion.

"Detection of drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies by antigen-capture ELISA and flow cytometry.
 The effectiveness of flow cytometry in the detection of drug-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies was investigated.
 In studies of seven sera known to contain quinine- or quinidine-dependent, platelet-reactive antibodies, flow cytometry was 5 to 10 times more sensitive in detecting drug-dependent antibodies (DDAbs) than the 51Cr release assay, antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and indirect immunofluorescence microscopic assay.
 With flow cytometry, DDAbs could be detected at drug concentrations as low as 0.1 microM, or less than one-tenth the level required with other methods.
 Antigen-capture ELISA was not as sensitive as flow cytometry in DDAb detection, but it did allow identification of the DDAbs' target molecules.
 With this assay, five of the seven DDAbs recognized both the glycoprotein Ib/IX (GPIb/IX) and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) complexes, while the remaining two sera reacted only with GPIb/IX.
 Of 44 consecutive patients who developed thrombocytopenia while taking quinidine, DDAbs were detected by flow cytometry in 11 (25%), more than twice the number detected by other methods.
 In one patient who developed thrombocytopenia while taking trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, DDAbs could be detected only by flow cytometry.
 It can be concluded that flow cytometry is highly sensitive in detecting DDAbs and allows their detection at pharmacologic concentrations of the drug.
 Most quinidine-dependent antibodies recognize at least two different glycoprotein complexes in the platelet membrane.

"Comparison of four pulse oximeters: effects of venous occlusion and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction.
 The ability of four pulse oximeters (the Ohmeda 3700, Nellcor N100 and N200 and the Datex Oscar) to detect hypoxaemia was determined in the presence of venous obstruction and cold-induced peripheral vasoconstriction.
 Significant increases in detection time for hypoxaemia were found in both cases.
 There were no significant differences in detection time between the instruments, although the Ohmeda 3700 displayed smaller values of SaO2 under certain conditions.
 Peripheral vasoconstriction was induced using three differing methods which gave differing results, thus emphasizing the importance of methodology in assessments of pulse oximetry.

"The role of antihistamines in otitis.
 Chronic and recurrent otitis media can manifest as otitis media with effusion.
 Both infection and eustachian tube obstruction (ETO) have been found to play an important role in its pathogenesis.
 ETO can be demonstrated during both early- and late-phase reactions in patients with allergic rhinitis after intranasal challenge with an allergen.
 Intranasal challenge with either histamine or prostaglandin D2 also provokes ETO, with the latter mediator perhaps more potent than the former.
 Middle ear effusions from patients with chronic or recurrent otitis media have been found to contain dramatically increased concentrations of histamine relative to the concentrations in their plasma.
 The development of nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in allergic rhinitis patients has been prevented by pretreatment with an antihistamine plus decongestant before intranasal challenge with pollen allergen.
 Investigations are currently under way to assess the effect of antihistamine pretreatment on nasal and eustachian tube obstruction in patients undergoing intranasal histamine challenge.

"Teflon versus thyroplasty versus nerve transfer: a comparison.
 Surgical rehabilitation of the paralyzed larynx is currently performed by Teflon injection, thyroplasty, and reinnervation techniques.
 Proponents of the two newer techniques maintain that they are preferred to Teflon injection because superior phonatory quality is achievable.
 This paper was written in an attempt to dissect the issues regarding this question.
 Teflon remains the quickest and least expensive procedure, but further experience with stroboscopic and other voice analyses reveals that the other procedures demonstrate some superiority in phonatory quality over Teflon.
 In this author's hands, the nerve transfer offers the best opportunity to achieve a normal phonatory voice.
 In addition, it is the only one of the three procedures that leaves the vocal cord entirely undisturbed--important in the event one of the other two procedures becomes necessary.

"Effects of GLQ223 on HIV replication in human monocyte/macrophages chronically infected in vitro with HIV.
 GLQ223 is a formulated version of tricosanthin, a single-chain ribosome-inactivating protein that was shown in earlier studies to inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in T-lymphoblastoid cells and to decrease HIV p24 levels in HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages as measured by flow cytometry.
 The current studies were performed to test the selectivity of the observed inhibitory effects on HIV replication in chronically infected macrophages infected in vitro.
 Peripheral blood-derived monocyte/macrophages were infected in vitro and cultivated in suspension for at least two weeks prior to GLQ223 treatment.
 Anti-HIV effects were quantitated by measurement of cytoplasmic HIV p24, by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry and HIV RNA levels were measured by slot blot analysis.
 Incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid- (TCA) precipitable protein was also evaluated as an index of nonspecific inhibitory effects mediated by the compound in infected and uninfected cultures.
 Five days after a single 3-h treatment with GLQ223 there was a concentration-dependent decrease in all measurable HIV parameters within infected cultures.
 The anti-HIV effects persisted at least 28 days without evidence for increasing HIV expression.
 GLQ223 treatment of parallel uninfected macrophage cultures showed no significant inhibition of tritiated leucine uptake.
 These experiments demonstrate that a single pulsed exposure with GLQ223 of macrophages infected with HIV in vitro caused a sustained, concentration-dependent decrease in both HIV p24 antigen levels as well as HIV RNA without causing measurable toxicity in uninfected cultures.

 Over a 4-year period (1982 to 1986), 91 patients with solitary or multiple metastases from colorectal cancer were stratified, based on findings at laparotomy, to one of three groups and then prospectively randomized to one of two treatment arms within each group.
 Group A patients had solitary resectable metastases, group B patients had multiple, resectable metastases, and group C patients had multiple, unresectable metastases.
 Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms within a group: group A-arm A1: resection only, arm A2: resection and continuous hepatic artery infusion (CHAI) of fluorodeoxyuridine (FUdR); group B-arm B1: resection and CHAI, arm B2: CHAI only; group C-arm C1: CHAI, arm C2: systemic fluorouracil followed by CHAI.

 Six patients with poor ovarian response to menotropin after pretreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog exhibited improved ovarian responsiveness when metoclopramide was added on days 3, 5, and 7 of the cycle.
 This was evidenced by a higher number of leading follicles (4.4 versus 0.6), a higher mean of maximal serum 17 beta-estradiol levels (560 versus 178 pg/mL), a shorter duration of menotropin treatment (7 versus 11 days), and fewer ampules of menotropin used (20 versus 37 ampules/cycle) in metoclopramide-treated cycles as compared with control cycles, respectively.
 Serum prolactin levels reached a maximum of 172 ng/mL within 1 hour after metoclopramide administration and declined to normal range within 6 hours.

"Left and right ventricular flows by Doppler echocardiography: serial measurements in patients with aortic regurgitation during exercise, cold pressor stimulation, and vasodilation.
 To test the practicality of Doppler echocardiography to measure serial change, biventricular outputs were measured in 15 patients with aortic regurgitation during control periods and during interventions of bicycle exercise, cold pressor stimulation, and vasodilation.
 Biventricular stroke volumes were measured in 10 normal subjects for validation of methods and differed by 2.8%.
 Reading errors were 3.7%.
 Signal quality improved between the first and last observation (p less than 0.05).
 Velocity signals were corrected for intercept angles, which averaged 12 and 19 degrees for right heart flows and 31 and 32 degrees for the left side of the heart in all subjects.
 Negative correlations occurred between intercept angles and the chronologic order in which the patients were studied for left (p = 0.02) and right (p = 0.05) flows.
 Mean flow areas varied 9% in the left ventricle and 20% in the right ventricle.
 Total variability for measuring flow determined from control values was 11% to 13%.
 When twice the variability was used as the detectable level of change, only exercise provoked real increases in biventricular flows in the majority of patients.
 We conclude that serial measurements of flow by Doppler echocardiographic methods had to exceed 20% to 25% to achieve significant change.
 Measuring intercept angle, resolving flow area, and learning are variables that need greater emphasis.

 This report documents the disturbance in gastrointestinal motor function in a patient with selective cholinergic dysautonomia that occurred following acute infectious mononucleosis.
 Apart from the gut, other organs affected included the pupils, sweat glands, lacrimal and salivary glands, and urinary bladder.
 Autonomic function tests showed the preservation of sympathetic adrenergic functions in contrast to the generalized involvement of postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic cholinergic nerves, including denervation hypersensitivity of the pupil and urinary bladder to exogenous cholinergic agonists.
 Cardiac and abdominal vagal responses were abnormal.
 Colon myenteric plexus ganglion cells were normal by morphological and immunohistochemical studies, suggesting that the selective cholinergic dysautonomia was the most likely pathophysiologic process responsible for the observed motility disorder.

 The authors dilated 103 stenosed crural arteries in 71 patients.
 Primary success was defined as traversing and reducing the lesion to a residual stenosis of less than 30%.

 Complications included one vessel rupture and one occluding intimal flap, which were treated by the vascular surgeon with bypass and venous patch, respectively.
 One hematoma at the puncture site was treated surgically because of its size.
 With modern materials such as steerable guide wires and low-profile balloon catheters, dilation of crural arteries has become safe.
 Until now, the indications for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of crural arteries have been limited to Fontaine stages III and IV disease.

"Prognostic significance of type IV collagen and laminin immunoreactivity in urothelial carcinomas of the bladder.
 Invasion of a carcinoma involves the degradation and penetration of the subepithelial basement membrane (BM).
 This phenomenon might be used for histopathologic evaluation of neoplasms of the bladder.
 The authors studied the clinicopathologic data and tissue specimens of 125 cases of urothelial carcinomas collected prospectively.
 Penetration of the BM was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of the BM components laminin and type IV collagen.
 The use of this parameter as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer was assessed.
 The 5-year survival rate of patients having tumors with an interrupted or absent BM was significantly lower than that of patients having tumors with an intact BM.
 The rate of progression was greater in tumors with an interrupted or absent BM than in tumors with an intact BM.
 No association was found between BM status and recurrence.
 However, a significant correlation between tumor stage and BM staining was found.
 A correlation was also found between ploidy and BM staining as well as between histologic grade and BM staining pattern.
 When evaluating histologic grade, stage, ploidy, age, and BM score as prognostic parameters, the stage of bladder carcinomas turned out to be the most important factor in predicting the survival rate and the progression-free survival.
 However, BM staining was found to be of value for early identification of microinvasion and is helpful for correct staging of urothelial carcinomas.

"Structure and distribution of an Alu-type deletion mutation in Sandhoff disease.
 Sandhoff disease is a recessively inherited lysosomal storage disease resulting from a deficiency of beta-hexosaminidase activity.
 The enzyme occurs in two major forms, beta-hexosaminidase A, composed of an alpha- and beta-subunit and beta-hexosaminidase B, composed of two beta-subunits.
 Both isozyme activities are deficient in Sandhoff disease, owing to mutations of the HEXB gene encoding the common beta-subunit.
 We have cloned and fully characterized a deletion at the HEXB gene from fibroblasts of a patient with the infantile form of Sandhoff disease.
 The deletion removes approximately 16 kb of DNA including the HEXB promoter, exons 1-5 and part of intron 5.
 It most likely arose from recombination between two Alu sequences, with the breakpoints occurring at the midpoint between the left and right arms in each case and regenerating an intact Alu element in the deletion sequence.
 The deletion allele accounts for 27% of the Sandhoff mutant alleles we analyzed.
 Two cell lines were shown to be homozygous for the deletion and both had the infantile form of the disease.
 Four additional patients were compound heterozygotes with other mutations, all of whom displayed a different clinical phenotype.
 Finally, the mutant allele was present in different ethnic backgrounds, suggesting that it may have been subject to genetic drift.

"Specificity of anti-Scl-70 antibodies in scleroderma: increased sensitivity of detection using purified DNA topoisomerase I from calf thymus.
 A large scale purification of DNA topoisomerase I from calf thymus was obtained using the combinations of 62% ammonium sulfate precipitation, Biorex 70, hydroxylapatite and phenylagarose chromatography.
 Silver staining of the preparation separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed 2 bands of apparent molecular weight of 70 and 60 kDa.
 Immunoblotting with a serum of anti-Scl-70 specificity also recognized both proteins.
 Anti-Scl-70 antibodies were detected in 24/32 (75%) patients with diffuse scleroderma by ELISA and 28/32 (87%) had the ability to neutralize the topoisomerase I activity.
 All of 14 sera with anticentromere antibodies did not react with DNA topoisomerase I by both assays.
 The presence of anti-Scl-70 antibodies remained disease specific despite the increase in sensitivity of both assays.

"Lead poisoning and thalassemia trait or iron deficiency. The value of the red blood cell distribution width.
 The cause of microcytosis and anemia in lead poisoning was investigated using red blood cell distribution width as a screening parameter in 21 consecutive patients with lead poisoning and seven nonrandomly selected patients with iron deficiency and lead poisoning.
 Of the 21 consecutive patients, 11 had microcytosis as defined by a mean corpuscular volume of less than 72 fL, nine had thalassemia trait (alpha or beta), one had both alpha thalassemia trait and iron deficiency, and one had iron deficiency.
 The red blood cell distribution width was less than 17.0 in those with thalassemia trait and greater than 17.0 in the iron-deficient subjects.
 Results of our study suggest that microcytosis in children with lead poisoning is due to coexistent iron deficiency or thalassemia trait.
 The red blood cell distribution width may be of value in the rapid assessment of the cause of microcytosis in children with lead poisoning.

"Open versus closed diagnostic peritoneal lavage in the evaluation of abdominal trauma.
 Two hundred forty-two patients underwent diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) over a 12-month period.
 One hundred sixteen patients (48%) were randomized to an open lavage technique and 126 (52%) to a percutaneous (closed) guide wire procedure.
 The closed procedure required an average of 16 minutes to complete with one operator, whereas the open method required two operators and an average time of 26 minutes (p less than 0.001).
 Technical complications occurred in 31 patients undergoing closed lavage (25%) and 4 patients undergoing open lavage (3%) (p less than 0.01).
 Fifty-eight percent of the closed lavage complications were related to fluid return and 42% to guide wire placement.
 All the open lavage complications were caused by inadequate fluid return.
 These data do not support the initial use of percutaneous lavage.
 The open technique is favored and certainly used when the closed method fails or when direct visualization of the peritoneal cavity is indicated.
 Physicians involved in the management of abdominal trauma must be familiar with both methods of DPL.

 Several lines of evidence indicate altered noradrenergic function in schizophrenia.
 The authors examined resting, standing, and change (standing minus resting) in plasma norepinephrine levels in 14 drug-free patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in 33 age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers.
 Schizophrenic patients had significantly higher resting and standing plasma norepinephrine levels and significantly greater change.

"Hemodynamic influence of LVAD on right ventricular failure.
 Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) pumping has hemodynamic and anatomic influences on right ventricular performance.
 A total artificial heart (TAH) model was employed to better understand the hemodynamic influence of an LVAD on the failing right ventricle.
 Biventricular failure was simulated by reducing both ventricular drive pressures of the TAH.
 After getting hemodynamic data, LVAD pumping in the case of right ventricular failure was simulated by increasing just the left ventricular drive pressure.
 In the LVAD-simulating condition, cardiac output increased and right atrial pressure decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) compared with the biventricular failure condition, whereas right ventricular function and minute work were the same in these two conditions.
 Even though changes were accompanied by adaptive increases in pulmonary resistance, substantially lower pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures resulted in the LVAD-simulating condition.
 From a hemodynamic perspective, these results indicate that an LVAD can increase right ventricular volume work by decreasing right ventricular pressure work, whereas right ventricular net pressure-volume work is unchanged and right ventricular failure is not worsened.

"Causes, diagnosis, and treatment of pharyngitis.
 Pharyngitis is a common disease of the respiratory tract that can be caused by several different viruses and bacterial organisms.
 Clinically speaking, the most important causative agent is group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes).
 Although rare, postpharyngitis complications arise as a result of disease caused almost exclusively by group A streptococcus.
 Because group A streptococcal pharyngitis usually responds well to antimicrobial treatment, it is important to diagnose it.
 Penicillin, erythromycin, and peroral first-generation cephalosporins have been documented to be effective.
 In addition to group A streptococcus, C.
 pneumoniae and M.
 pneumoniae have also been detected in patients with pharyngitis.
 The possibility of diagnosing these organisms is limited at the present.
 Clinical surveys are still needed, moreover, to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial treatment on the disease caused by these organisms.
 Although routine viral diagnostic methods do not help primary care physicians in treating patients with pharyngitis, information on bacteria and viruses in the immediate environment could prove to be of great help in daily clinical work.

"Leucine metabolism in IDDM. Role of insulin and substrate availability.
 The effect of insulin on plasma amino acid concentrations and leucine metabolism was examined in 18 healthy nondiabetic young volunteers and in 7 subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) with the euglycemic insulin-clamp technique (40 mU.m-2.min-1) in combination with [1-14C]leucine.
 All diabetic subjects were studied while in poor metabolic control (fasting glucose 13.3 +/- 1.1 mM; HbA1c 10.8 +/- 0.2%) and again after 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy (fasting glucose 7.2 +/- 0.5 mM; HbA1c 8.0 +/- 0.2%).
 Insulin-mediated total-body glucose uptake in poorly controlled diabetic subjects (3.6 +/- 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) was significantly reduced compared with control subjects (7.5 +/- 0.2 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .001) and improved slightly after insulin therapy (4.8 +/- 0.3 mg.kg-1.min-1; P less than .05), although it still remained significantly lower than in control subjects (P less than .01).
 During the insulin-clamp study performed in subjects with poorly controlled IDDM, endogenous leucine flux (ELF), leucine oxidation (LO), and nonoxidative leucine disposal (NOLD) all decreased (50.1 +/- 2.0 to 26.4 +/- 0.4; 9.2 +/- 0.4 to 6.0 +/- 0.3; 40.9 +/- 2.0 to 20.4 +/- 2.0 mumol.m-2.min-1, respectively) to the same extent as in control subjects.
 After 2 mo of intensified insulin therapy, the effect of acute hyperinsulinemia on ELF, LO, and NOLD was comparable to that of control subjects, whereas insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism was still impaired.
 To examine the effect of substrate availability on leucine turnover, well-regulated IDDM and control subjects underwent a repeat insulin-clamp study combined with a balanced amino acid infusion designed to increase circulating plasma amino acid levels approximately twofold.
 Under these conditions, NOLD was equally enhanced above baseline in both control and IDDM subjects (P less than .01), whereas ELF was inhibited to a greater extent (P less than .01) than during the insulin clamp performed without amino acid infusion (control vs.
 diabetic subjects, NS).
 In conclusion, insulin-mediated glucose metabolism is severely impaired in subjects with both poorly controlled and well-controlled IDDM, whereas the effect of acute insulin infusion on leucine turnover is normal, and combined hyperaminoacidemia/hyperinsulinemia stimulated NOLD to a similar extent in both IDDM and control subjects.

"Alcohol use and depressive symptoms among Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites.
 Alcohol use is associated with depressive symptoms in several studies.
 Using data from a community survey, this study examined whether this relationship (a) can be accounted for by ethnic or sociodemographic differences among persons who engage in various levels of alcohol use; and (b) differs for Mexican Americans (N = 1244) and non-Hispanic Whites (N = 1149).
 Using large quantities of alcohol, and, among men, daily drinking, were associated with depressed mood.
 These associations were similar for Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic Whites, and associations of quantity and frequency with depression were independent of each other.
 Among women, the cultural and demographic characteristics of high-quantity drinkers and abstainers (both of whom tended to be Mexican Americans) accounted for the association of alcohol use with depression.
 Among men, there was some suggestion that unemployment and unmarried status mediated the association of alcohol quantity with depression.
 People who drank greater quantities of alcohol per occasion reported more somatic depressive symptoms, and more frequent male drinkers reported more of most types of depressive symptoms.

"Use of auscultation to follow patients with mitral systolic clicks and murmurs.
 Mitral systolic clicks and murmurs together with associated symptoms constitute a major reason for cardiologic referral.
 Although echocardiography with Doppler study enables characterization of the mitral valve apparatus and quantification of regurgitation, its use has resulted in an overemphasis of the technical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and an undervaluation of diagnosis based on physical examination.
 To determine the clinical significance of an auscultatory classification of mitral systolic clicks with or without precordial systolic murmurs, 1 consultant's medical records of 291 patients with these signs were reviewed.
 Based on initial auscultatory findings, patients were divided into: (1) single or multiple apical systolic clicks with no murmur (n = 99); (2) single or multiple apical systolic clicks and a late systolic murmur (n = 129); and (3) single or multiple apical clicks and an apical pansystolic murmur or murmur beginning in the first half of systole (n = 63).
 The average duration of patient follow-up was 8 years (range 1 to 30).
 The prognosis was excellent for patients from all 3 classes.
 Two cardiac-related deaths occurred: 1 each from classes 1 and 2.
 Mitral valve surgery was performed in 3 class 2 patients (2%) and in 2 class 3 patients (3%).
 No patients developed endocarditis during follow-up.
 Palpitations, with varying anxiety overlay, constituted a major indication for cardiologic referral in all 3 classes.
 Auscultatory findings were valuable to the physician for explanation and relief of patient anxiety.
 For patient management, use of an auscultatory classification may be preferable to the technically generated term ""mitral valve prolapse."".

 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the Injury Severity Score (ISS) correlates with the resource requirements of severely injured patients by studying the association of the ISS with three major interventions (fluid resuscitation, invasive central nervous system monitoring, and acute operative repair) trauma centers routinely provide severely injured patients.
 DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review.
 SETTING: Level I trauma center.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Eight hundred fourteen adult injured patients.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: When an ISS of more than 9 was used as the definition of major trauma, the ISS undercorrelated 11% of the time with the need for any one procedure.
 When an ISS of more than 14 was used as the definition, it undercorrelated 20% of the time.
 CONCLUSION: The ISS may not be completely correlated with the resource requirements of injured patients and should not be used as the sole means by which to define major injury.

"Alterations in splanchnic blood flow following chronic ethanol exposure.
 The purpose of these experiments was to determine whether or not tolerance develops to the effect of 3.0 g/kg ethanol on total and regional splanchnic blood flow in male Wistar rats.
 The animals were given the Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 10 days; ethanol-fed animals were withdrawn 24 hr prior to experiments.
 Regional blood flow and cardiac output (CO) were measured by the reference microsphere technique after an intraperitoneal injection of 3.0 g/kg of ethanol.
 Acute ethanol administration produced early nonsustained increases in portal vein blood flow in animals fed ethanol for 10 days and withdrawn for 24 hr and in control animals.
 However, after chronic exposure to ethanol, the pattern of increase in blood flow in response to ethanol in the splanchnic organs was different between the ethanol-fed and control groups.
 Increases in portal vein flow in control groups were due to concomitant increases in small intestinal, colonic, and cecal blood flow while the increase in the ethanol-fed group was due to a rise in small intestinal and stomach blood flow.
 The increase in stomach blood flow that occurred in the animals treated chronically with ethanol may be viewed as a conditioned response to ethanol, since this was not found in the control group.
 These results, demonstrate that the pattern of increase in blood flow in the splanchnic organs produced by an acute dose of ethanol depends on the animal's previous exposure to ethanol.

"Kinin/prostaglandin system: its therapeutic value in surgical stress.
 Multiple system organ failure as a consequence of injury or sepsis remains the major reason for death in critically ill patients.
 One of the treatment concepts that has recently attracted clinical attention is the administration of kinins and prostaglandins (PGs).
 On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress.
 However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce.
 On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients.
 Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing.
 It remains to be seen whether this concept will be useful in the treatment of critically ill surgical patients.

 To see whether changes in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal disease in the USA have been accompanied by a corresponding change in serotype distribution, epidemiological and M-typing and T-typing data for 5193 strains sent to the Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, between 1972 and 1988 were analysed.
 The proportions of M-types 1, 3, and 18 increased significantly during the study period.
 These M-types were more likely to be invasive, to cause fatal infection, and to occur in a cluster of infections than were other types.
 By contrast, the proportions of M-types 4 and 12 decreased; they were less invasive and were less likely to be found in clusters than were other types.
 These data suggest that changes in the epidemiology of group A streptococcal disease may be related to changes in the distribution of M-types causing infection.

"Inhibition of cell mediated cytotoxicity by sulphasalazine: effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on in vitro natural killer cell activity.
 Decreased cell mediated cytotoxicity occurs frequently in inflammatory bowel disease, particularly in patients with active disease.
 It is not clear, however, whether this decrease is caused by the disease or is a consequence of the medical treatment.
 In this study we evaluated the effect of in vivo treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid and sulphasalazine on the in vitro natural killer cell activity in five patients with inflammatory bowel disease in remission and in four healthy control subjects in a double blind randomised crossover trial preceded and separated by four weeks of treatment with placebo.
 The natural killer cell activity was significantly impaired in 67% (six of nine subjects) after four weeks' sulphasalazine treatment and tended to be related to subjects with a slow acetylator phenotype.
 In contrast, 5-aminosalicylic acid treatment caused only a marginal reaction in the natural killer cell activity in 22% (two of nine subjects).
 The inhibitory effects were found to be reversible since the decreased natural killer cell activity was completely restored after placebo treatment in all subjects.
 In conclusion, in vivo treatment with sulphasalazine inhibits the in vitro natural killer cell activity and this seems to be mediated by the sulphapyridine moiety.
 This phenomenon may contribute to the low natural killer cell activity found in patients with active inflammatory bowel disease.

 Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a destructive disease of the lung characteristically associated with central bronchiectasis.
 This study was designed to determine if high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) could be used to define bronchiectasis in patients with suspected disease.
 Sixteen patients with asthma were studied.
 All demonstrated immediate cutaneous reactivity to common aeroallergens including Aspergillus fumigatus.
 Eight patients had clinical and immunologic evidence of ABPA.
 Six to 12 high-resolution CT sections (1.5 mm) were obtained at 1- to 2-cm intervals from the aortic knob to the dome of the diaphragm.
 All radiographs were evaluated separately by two readers in a blinded fashion and graded as to the presence and type of bronchial dilatation and bronchial wall thickening.
 Bronchial dilatation was seen in 41% of lung lobes in the ABPA group compared to 15% in the non-ABPA asthmatic control group.
 Upper lobe involvement and bronchial wall thickening was common to both groups.
 The presence of bronchiectasis in the control group may indicate that asthma is a more destructive lung disease than is currently appreciated.
 High-resolution CT of the chest has been shown in previous studies to have a sensitivity and specificity approaching that of bronchography, and the current findings support its use in the detection of bronchiectasis in patients with asthma suspected of having ABPA.

 Forty patients with widely disseminated or locally advanced malignant obstruction of the middle or lower third of the oesophagus underwent endoscopic treatment by either NdYAG laser recanalization or intubation.
 Groups were matched on the basis of tumour location and swallowing was graded clinically before and after treatment.
 Technical success was achieved in 17 of 20 laser treated and 18 of 20 intubated patients.
 Pretreatment swallowing ability, histology, tumour location and overall length were unrelated to functional outcome in both groups.
 However, circumferential tumour length identified endoscopically strongly influenced the quality of swallowing after laser recanalization.
 Patients with excellent swallowing quality (n = 7) had significantly shorter circumferential tumour lengths, 3.1(1.0) cm, than those with poorer quality swallowing (n = 10), 6.3(1.6)cm, (P less than 0.001).
 Both methods of treatment had low complication rates and there was one death in the series in the laser-treated group.
 Laser recanalization provides a better functional result than intubation for short (less than 4 cm) circumferential tumour.
 Intubation at a single session seems more appropriate than repeated laser therapy when tumour length exceeds 4 cm.

"Role of leukotriene B4 in granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic feline intestine.
 Several studies have demonstrated that granulocytes accumulate in the intestinal mucosa following ischemia/reperfusion.
 It has been suggested that leukotriene B4 may be released during ischemia/reperfusion and consequently may promote granulocyte infiltration into the mucosa.
 The objectives of this study were to determine whether (a) leukotriene B4 is produced in the gut mucosa during ischemia and reperfusion, and (b) inhibition of leukotriene B4 attenuates granulocyte infiltration into the postischemic intestinal mucosa.
 Isolated segments of cat intestine were subjected to 3 hours of ischemia and 1 hour of reperfusion.
 Mucosal samples were obtained during baseline, ischemia at 3 hours and reperfusion at 1 hour.
 Leukotriene B4 production was determined by radioimmunoassay.
 Tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity was used to quantitate granulocyte accumulation in the mucosal samples.
 In untreated animals, mucosal leukotriene B4 concentration was higher at reperfusion compared with baseline levels.
 The reperfusion-induced increase in mucosal leukotriene B4 was entirely prevented by pretreatment with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
 Louis, MO) or L663,536 (Merck-Frosst, Montreal, Quebec, Canada), two potent lipoxygenase inhibitors.
 Both lipoxygenase inhibitors, as well as leukotriene B4 antagonist (SC-41930) significantly attenuated the reperfusion-induced infiltration of granulocytes.
 These results indicate that leukotriene B4 plays an important role in mediating the granulocyte accumulation elicited by reperfusion of the ischemic bowel.

"Early 24-hour blood pressure elevation in normotensive subjects with parental hypertension 
 Subjects with a family history of parental hypertension are reported to have a slightly higher office blood pressure in the prehypertensive stage.
 Whether this reflects a hyperreactivity to blood pressure measurement or a more permanent blood pressure elevation, however, is not known.
 In the present study, blood pressure was measured in 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are both hypertensive (FH++), 15 normotensive subjects with one hypertensive parent (FH(+)-), and 15 normotensive subjects whose parents are not hypertensive (FH--); among the three groups, subjects were matched for age, sex, and body mass index.
 The measurements were made in the office during a variety of laboratory stressors and during a prolonged resting period, and for a 24-hour period (ambulatory blood pressure monitoring).
 Office blood pressure was higher in the FH++ group than in the FH-- group (p less than 0.05).
 The pressor responses to laboratory stressors were similar in the two groups, but the FH++ group had higher prolonged resting and 24-hour blood pressure than the FH-- group; the difference was always significant (p less than 0.05) for systolic blood pressure.
 The FH++ group also had a greater left ventricular mass index (on echocardiographic examination) than the FH-- group (p less than 0.01).
 The blood pressure values and echocardiographic values of the FH(+)- group tended to be between those of the other two groups.
 Thus, the higher blood pressure shown by individuals in the prehypertensive stage with a family history of parental hypertension does not reflect a hyperreactivity to stress but an early permanent blood pressure elevation.

 Stage A1 tumors generally are indolent, whereas stage A2 tumors are more aggressive.
 The natural history of stage B lesions is not well documented.

"Distribution of pulmonary capillary transit times in recruited networks.
 When pulmonary blood flow is elevated, hypoxemia can occur in the fastest-moving erythrocytes if their transit times through the capillaries fall below the minimum time for complete oxygenation.
 This desaturation is more likely to occur if the distribution of capillary transit times about the mean is large.
 Increasing cardiac output is known to decrease mean pulmonary capillary transit time, but the effect on the distribution of transit times has not been reported.
 We measured the mean and variance of transit times in single pulmonary capillary networks in the dependent lung of anesthetized dogs by in vivo videofluorescence microscopy of a fluorescein dye bolus passing from an arteriole to a venule.
 When cardiac output increased from 2.9 to 9.9 l/min, mean capillary transit time decreased from 2.0 to 0.8 s.
 Because transit time variance decreased proportionately (relative dispersion remained constant), increasing cardiac output did not alter the heterogeneity of local capillary transit times in the lower lung where the capillary bed was nearly fully recruited.

"Change in sympathetic activity before, during, and after dialysis-induced hypotension.
 During the hemodialyses of eight patients with end-stage renal failure, who often had sudden-onset dialysis-induced hypotension, catecholamine (CA) levels were measured in the ultrafiltrate obtained by a mini-filter placed in series upstream of the dialyzer.
 The water evaporation rate from the skin (reflecting the perspiration rate) was also monitored.
 Results showed a temporary elevation in CA levels in the ultrafiltrate before hypotension occurred.
 This rise did not continue for long, returning to baseline when hypotension actually occurred.
 The temporary elevation may reflect transient compensation by the sympathetic nervous system for the decrease in vascular wall tension.
 It was also found that there was considerable water evaporation from the skin during hypotension.
 Because sweat gland activity is reflexively modulated by the baroreceptor, perspiration after a drop in blood pressure may reflect the normal diminiution in baroreceptor activity.

"Nasolaryngoscopy for family physicians.
 Nasolaryngoscopy is easy to learn and safe and convenient to perform.
 It is readily accepted by patients and is a rich source of clinical information.
 The flexible nasolaryngoscope allows the physician to directly observe the anatomy of the nasal passages, pharynx and larynx.
 The procedure is helpful for identifying the etiology of chronic nasal complaints and hoarseness.
 Other possible indications for nasolaryngoscopy include suspected nasal foreign body, recurrent nasal or pharyngeal bleeding, and epiglottitis.
 With the use of this instrument, treatment of otolaryngologic conditions may be more specific, thereby reducing unnecessary referral or delay in treatment.

"The role of elective lymph node dissection in the management of patients with thick cutaneous melanoma.
 A retrospective search of patients seen at the Duke Melanoma Clinic from 1970 to 1986 identified 308 clinically Stage I patients, with 4.0 to 10.0 mm cutaneous melanomas.
 Five-year and ten-year survival was 56% and 43%, respectively.
 Elective lymph node dissection (ELND) was done in 116 patients (37.7%); there was no difference in disease-free interval (DFI) or survival between these patients versus patients treated with wide excision only (P = 0.9).
 Thirty-two patients (27.6%) had pathologically positive nodes on ELND.
 These patients had a shorter DFI (P = 0.05) and survival (P = 0.03) compared with patients with negative node dissections.
 When further divided by Breslow's thickness, this difference persisted in patients with 4.0 to 6.0 mm lesions (P = 0.01).
 However, for thicker lesions (greater than 6.0 mm), there was no difference in survival between the node-negative and node-positive groups (P = 0.9).
 The mean follow-up was 7.1 years.
 Elective lymph node dissection was not done in 192 patients; 78 of these recurred first in the regional nodes.
 These 78 patients were compared with the 32 patients who had pathologically positive nodes by ELND to see if patient survival was improved by early removal of nodal disease.
 There was no difference in DFI (P = 0.5) or survival (P = 0.3) between these two groups.
 It is concluded that ELND may provide prognostic information for patients with thick cutaneous melanomas.
 However, there was no change in DFI or ultimate survival when patients were followed, and nodes removed when clinically positive.
 The authors do not recommend ELND for patients with thick melanomas because the risk of distant metastases outweighs any benefit of regional node dissection.

"Conservative surgery and radiation therapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the wrist, hand, ankle, and foot.
 Seventy-eight patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) arising in the distal extremities--wrist, hand, finger, ankle, foot, and toe--who were treated with conservation surgery and radiation therapy were studied retrospectively with respect to survival, local recurrence, functional limb preservation, complications, and distant metastasis.
 After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, actuarial 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 80% and 69%, respectively, and disease-free rates were 61% and 51% at the same times.
 Actuarial local control rates were 80% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively.
 Fifteen patients (19%) had local recurrence, but 12 of these were salvaged.
 Ultimately, 53 patients (68%) retained a normal or fairly normal extremity, six (8%) needed amputation for complications, and 13 (17%) needed amputation to control recurrent disease.
 The functional outcome was significantly better for patients with upper extremity lesions than for those with lower extremity tumors; even for the latter, this treatment strategy was preferable to amputation.
 The incidence of hematogenous metastases from distal extremity sarcomas depends on the size of the primary tumor.
 It was concluded that conservation surgery and radiation therapy (XRT) is an acceptable treatment strategy for STS arising in distal extremities; it yielded a high rate of disease control and functional limb preservation.

"Paradoxes in the history of the anterior cruciate ligament.
 A historic review of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) investigation reveals two important paradoxes.
 (1) Ideas and concepts recently proposed were first put forth much earlier.
 (2) Controversy regarding this ligament continues despite the increased amount of information available.
 Much of the recent ACL literature, although regarded as newly discovered, has its roots in far older, and apparently forgotten or overlooked, work.
 Examples include: (1) ACL intactness is best tested at full extension; (2) hemarthrosis and ACL rupture are closely associated; and (3) ACL rupture sometimes masquerades as a minor injury.
 Additionally, early investigators achieved notable advances in surgical techniques.
 These contributions disappeared from the literature for two major reasons.
 First, early investigators observed few patients, with typical practitioners rarely seeing ACL injuries, and consequently, little data existed to support their observations.
 Second, observations could not be confirmed until the advent of widespread, successful surgery.
 Undoubtedly, orthopedists now know much more about the ACL, yet many issues remain controversial.
 Does the ACL perform a vital function? What is the efficacy of operative versus nonoperative treatment? What are the relative merits of direct repair, intraarticular substitutes, and extraarticular nonanatomic procedures? The origins and continued existence of controversy stem from several sources, including the less than rigorous study design and the scarcity of natural history, long-term follow-up studies, and basic science studies.
 The perception of the ACL as a simple structural unit has also perpetuated this controversy.

"The utility of circulating levels of human pancreatic polypeptide as a marker for islet cell tumors.
 The measurement of plasma levels of human pancreatic polypeptide (hPP) has been reported to be clinically useful in predicting the existence of pancreatic islet cell neoplasms in patients with familial multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (FMEN-I) and the possible presence of metastatic disease in patients with islet cell tumors.
 However, these studies have not been prospective and involve small numbers of patients.
 In this study, fasting plasma samples from 36 patients with biopsy-proved islet cell tumors were analyzed for hPP by radioimmunoassay and compared with age-matched control subjects.
 Of 13 patients with FMEN-I who had islet cell tumors, 7 (54%) had elevated plasma hPP levels before surgery.
 After resection of all islet cell tumors, 4 of 12 patients evaluated after surgery still had elevated levels.
 Fifteen patients had islet cell tumors that were localized (seven insulinomas and eight gastrinomas), but none of these patients had elevated hPP levels, either before or after surgery.
 Nine patients, including one with FMEN-I, with metastatic islet cell tumors to the liver were studied; three with more advanced disease had elevated hPP levels before surgery.
 Each of the nine patients underwent resection of all gross disease and the three patients with elevated preoperative levels had normal postoperative hPP levels.
 Our results indicate that basal plasma levels of hPP were not clinically useful.
 The hPP levels did not reliably predict the presence of islet cell tumors in patients with FMEN-I, because 46% of patients with tumors did not have elevated plasma levels, and in those with elevated values hPP levels did not reliably predict the resection of all tumor.
 Plasma levels of hPP have no utility in patients with localized sporadically occurring islet cell tumors and limited utility (33%) in predicting the presence of metastatic islet cell tumors to the liver.

"Lack of effect of clonidine and pentoxifylline in short-term therapy of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
 The goal of this study was to confirm or rule out anecdotal reports of beneficial effects of clonidine and pentoxifylline in the treatment of painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy.
 Clonidine was administered to 16 subjects at two dosage levels (0.1 and 0.2 mg/day) and was compared to placebo in a crossover design, with each phase lasting 4 wk.
 Either pentoxifylline (400 mg 3 times/day) or placebo was given to 21 subjects in a 12-wk trial.
 Discomfort was characterized and rated with a subjective pain score (range 0-20).
 There was a significant decrease in pain score from baseline with both active drugs (P less than 0.05), but this was no better than the response to placebo (P less than 0.30 for clonidine and P less than 0.95 for pentoxifylline).

"Circadian rhythm of heart rate variability after acute myocardial infarction and its influence on the prognostic value of heart rate variability.
 This study examined heart rate (HR) variability in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to find the optimum time and duration of recording of the ambulatory electrocardiogram for the prediction of the risk of sudden cardiac death, or serious arrhythmic events, or both.
 Twenty patients (group I) who initially survived an AMI but later experienced serious events (death or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia) during a 6-month follow-up were compared with 20 patients (group II) who remained free of complications for greater than 6 months after discharge.
 Groups I and II were matched with regard to age, gender, infarct site, ejection fraction, and beta-blocker treatment.
 HR variability was assessed in the 24-hour electrocardiograms recorded during the first 2 weeks after an AMI and in various portions of the complete 24-hour recording, with both the beginning and the length of the analyzed portion varied by 20 minutes (a total of 5,113 possibilities).
 The maximum reduction of HR variability in group I patients was systematically found when assessing HR variability in recordings starting approximately at 6 A.M.
 and lasting for approximately 8 hours.
 In the low-risk patient, the diurnal rhythm of HR variability is more marked than in the high-risk patient and the long-term components of HR variability due to the diurnal variation must be included in the measurement of HR variability when using it as a long-term predictor of risk from arrhythmic events after an AMI.

"Can heart failure be prevented, delayed, or reversed?
 A review of the clinical course of chronic heart failure demonstrates that current outcomes remain highly unsatisfactory both in mortality and perhaps more important in morbidity.
 The extraordinary satisfactory functional responses seen in patients who undergo cardiac transplantation clearly identify the primary cause as the status of the heart itself, whatever the pathophysiologic adjustments of the neuroendocrine system, and interventions of the wide variety of drugs.
 Since donor hearts are unlikely to be available even from younger sufferers of these clinical syndromes, prevention must be the hallmark.
 Protection of the viability of myocytes, such as in acute myocarditis and acute infarction, is essential.
 Myocardial collagen undergoes continual synthesis, and production is greatly stimulated in the presence of hypertrophy caused by increased wall stress.
 It is possible that excess collagen is intimately involved with diastolic ventricular dysfunction, but that this may be a reversible process if the collagen-producing stimulus is removed.
 Thus reduction in wall stress and reversibility of ventricular hypertrophy appear to be promising directions.
 However, to limit the catastrophic effects of chronic heart failure, early recognition of the precursors of these syndromes, prevention of progression, and surgical intervention in valvular heart disease at an optimal point in time are essential.

"Physicochemical determinants of in vitro shock-wave biliary lithotripsy.
 Human gallstones were studied by visual inspection, computerized tomographic imaging, and chemical analysis to assess physicochemical characteristics that may determine the outcome of in vitro shock-wave fragmentation.
 Eighty-five stones (mean diameter: 13.2 +/- 5 mm) were each collected from different patients.
 Fifty-five (65%) calculi were angular and 30 (35%) round or oval-shaped.
 Three easily obtained measures were derived from each stone's optimal computerized tomographic image including the mean stone density, a measure corresponding to the standard deviation of the mean stone density value which we termed the stone density distribution index and which may reflect the physicochemical heterogeneity of a given gallstone, as well as the density range.
 After the administration of 2500 shock waves using an electrohydraulic generator, fragmentation was noted in 68 calculi (80%) and was satisfactory in 27 (32%) (where the largest resulting fragment diameters were all less than or equal to 5 mm).
 Strong determinants of satisfactory fragmentation on multivariate analysis included a stone diameter of less than or equal to 15 mm, the presence of an angular stone shape, and a stone density distribution index of greater than or equal to 60 Hounsfield units.
 The other parameters did not independently determine satisfactory fragmentation.
 Prospective clinical trials are needed to assess whether these findings result in a better prediction of the success of extracorporeal biliary lithotripsy and a broadening of its indications.

"Comparison of ventricular arrhythmia induction with use of an indwelling electrode catheter and a newly inserted catheter.
 Two methods of serial electrophysiologic testing are in widespread use.
 Most commonly, the electrode catheter is removed after each study and a new catheter reinserted through the femoral vein for every subsequent test.
 An alternative method employs an electrode catheter that remains in place during several days of serial testing.
 Little is known about differences between these two methods with respect to the likelihood of induction of arrhythmia or the frequency of complications.
 To determine whether inducibility of sustained arrhythmia is altered or if the frequency of complications is unacceptably high with use of an indwelling catheter, a prospective randomized study was conducted in 78 patients.
 Each patient underwent baseline testing, several days of electropharmacologic testing with an indwelling catheter, a 24 h drug elimination period and placement of a new electrode catheter.
 Ventricular stimulation studies were then performed in each patient with both the indwelling and new electrode catheters.
 No differences were found between the indwelling and new catheter tests with respect to induction of arrhythmia, number of extrastimuli required to induce arrhythmia, rate of arrhythmia or requirement for cardioversion.
 Ventricular pacing thresholds were higher and effective refractory periods were slightly longer when measured with the indwelling catheter.
 Complications related to the 156 catheter insertions included two that may have been related to the indwelling catheter (one episode of staphylococcal sepsis and one presumed pulmonary embolism) and four that were related to invasive procedures (pneumothorax in all).
 There were no long-term adverse sequelae of these complications.

"Sotalol versus quinidine for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion of atrial fibrillation 
 This open, parallel-group study compares quinidine and sotalol treatment for maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation.
 The patients from 15 centers in Sweden were randomized to sotalol (98 patients) or quinidine (85 patients) after 2 hours of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion.
 According to primary efficacy assessment, 52% of the patients in the sotalol group and 48% of the patients in the quinidine group remained in sinus rhythm during the following 6-month treatment period (NS).
 Furthermore, 34% of the patients treated with sotalol and 22% of the patients treated with quinidine relapsed into atrial fibrillation (NS).
 Heart rate after relapsing into atrial fibrillation was higher in the patients treated with quinidine (109 beats/min) than in the patients treated with sotalol (78 beats/min, p less than 0.001).
 Patients treated with sotalol were found to be less symptomatic at the time of relapse compared with relapsing patients in the quinidine group.
 In terms of safety, more patients were withdrawn from quinidine than from sotalol treatment (26% vs.
 11%, p less than 0.05), and sotalol was generally better tolerated than quinidine.
 Twenty-eight percent of the patients treated with sotalol and 50% of the patients treated with quinidine reported side effects (p less than 0.01).
 The difference was primarily a result of early (within the first month of treatment) gastrointestinal and skin side effects in the group of patients treated with quinidine.

 Pain was more sensitive than Ritchie's index.
 Several variables may be omitted from clinical trials, especially if two active drugs are being compared.
 For example, the best maximum estimate for the difference in ESR between NSAIDs and placebo was 1.0 mm/hr (95% confidence interval -1.5 to 3.4 mm/hr), and for joint size 0.44% (-1.0 to 1.9%), corresponding to a quarter of a millimeter for each of the 10 joints usually measured.

 We studied 32 infants and children less than 12 years of age using pulse oximetry and continuous electrocardiography before, during, and after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy performed under intravenous sedation.
 Sinus tachycardia was the most common electrocardiographic change, and no clinically significant electrocardiographic abnormalities were induced by the procedure.
 Desaturation to less than or equal to 90% was found in 37.5% of the patients and was most commonly noted during the endoscopy procedure and in patients with cardiopulmonary disease.
 The desaturation was unpredictable because there was no correlation between desaturation and medication, tolerance to the procedure, weight, or age of the child.
 Some patients who subjectively appeared to tolerate the procedure well had significant desaturation.

 Two valveless, single orifice counterpulsation devices, with pumping stroke volumes of 65 ml each, were implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery of seven open chest anesthetized dogs.
 After completion of the preparation, ventricular fibrillation was induced.
 The devices were synchronized to pump simultaneously at a rate of 85-100 bpm.
 The combined use of the counterpulsation devices provided maximal aortic pressure of 111.4 +/- 25.1 mmHg during ventricular fibrillation for a period of 15-60 min.
 The mean left ventricular pressure was 17.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg, and the cardiac index 64.5 +/- 23.6 ml/kg/min.
 Cardioversion of ventricular fibrillation to sinus rhythm restored normal hemodynamics.
 The counterpulsation device implanted on the ascending aorta was not able to maintain circulation for more than 5 min after the induction of ventricular fibrillation, if used alone.
 In conclusion, the use of two counterpulsation devices implanted on the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery was able to maintain circulation in experimental animals during ventricular fibrillation.

"Insulin-like growth factor-II: possible local growth factor in pheochromocytoma.
 Pheochromocytomas, neural crest tumors, express an abundance of insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II).
 To assess further the potential for IGF-II to play an autocrine role for these tumors, we measured 1) IGF-II content by RRA in 7 pheochromocytomas and peripheral blood in these patients, 2) IGF-II receptors by Western analysis, and 3) characterized the tumor binding proteins by ligand blot studies.
 IGF-II levels in the tumors varied from 2.8-41 micrograms/g.
 Chromatography revealed that 60% of the peptide eluted as a large mol wt form of IGF-II (8.7-10 kDa); the remainder coeluted with mature peptide (7.5 kDa).
 This was in contrast to IGF-II levels in normal adrenal tissue (0.225 +/- 0.005 micrograms/g) or another neural crest-derived tumor, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (0.63 +/- 0.02 micrograms/g).
 Serum IGF-II levels in the 7 patients with pheochromocytoma (720 +/- 71 ng/mL) were similar to those in 35 normal controls (762 +/- 69 ng/mL).
 Radiolabeled IGF-II (9 +/- 1%) and IGF-I (20 +/- 2%) bound specifically to pheochromocytoma membranes.
 Western analysis of these membranes using a specific antiserum directed against the type II receptor demonstrated a band at 210 kDa.
 Affinity cross-linking studies with [125I]IGF-I demonstrated a specific band at 140 kDa.
 Ligand blot analysis was performed on the void volume pools from the Sephadex G-75 column and demonstrated bands at about 30 and 25 kDa.
 In conclusion, these data 1) confirm that pheochromocytomas have increased levels of IGF-II; 2) demonstrate that despite high IGF-II concentrations in the tumors, peripheral levels are not elevated, suggesting that very little tumoral IGF-II is released into the circulation, unlike catecholamines; 3) demonstrate the presence of IGF-II and IGF-I receptors; 4) describe binding protein species similar to those present in other tissues.
 Thus, the presence of high levels of IGF-II and both type I and type II receptors suggests that IGF II may act through both receptors to alter tumor growth.

"Modification of stroke susceptibility by genotype-dependent maternal influences.
 The influence of the prenatal and postnatal maternal environment on stroke susceptibility was evaluated by reciprocally crossing the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) inbred rat strains to produce reciprocal F1 hybrids that were nurtured, respectively, during prenatal and postnatal life by SHR or SS/Jr mothers.
 Following placement on a high-salt diet containing 8% NaCl at 35 days of age, F1 rats reared by SHR mothers had shorter survival times and were more likely to die with cerebral hemorrhage than F1s reared by SS/Jrs.
 Across reciprocal F1 female groups, enhanced susceptibility to stroke was associated with greater elevations of systolic blood pressure, but this association was not seen across reciprocal F1 male groups.
 There was also an association between blood pressure and stroke within each F1/gender subgroup: Rats eventually suffering strokes developed higher blood pressure after placement on the high-salt diet than rats that did not suffer stroke.
 Lower day 35 body weights (before exposure to the high-salt diet) were associated with greater likelihood of stroke both across the reciprocal F1 groups, and within three of the four F1/gender subgroups.
 The differences in stroke susceptibility between the reciprocal F1 groupings may be due to systematic differences in the prenatal and/or postnatal environments of SHR and SS/Jr mothers and may be mediated by variations in the nutritive capacity of the two inbred mothers.

"Endothelin family in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.
 To clarify whether endothelin may be present in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and, if it exists, to compare its molecular forms with those of endothelin in human plasma, we analyzed pooled human CSF and plasma by high performance liquid chromatography with specific enzyme immunoassays for each endothelin peptide.
 Of the four human endothelin peptides hitherto identified, big endothelin-1 was the major molecular form of endothelin present in human CSF.
 In addition, there was a small but significant amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in CSF, while endothelin-2 was not detectable.
 Similarly, big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 were identified in human plasma.
 Although big endothelin-1 was the most abundant, a substantial amount of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 was found in plasma with a resultant lower molar ratio of big endothelin-1 to endothelin-1 than in CSF.
 In all CSF samples from 17 patients requiring diagnostic lumbar puncture or lumbar anesthesia, endothelin was detectable, with a preponderance of big endothelin-1 relative to endothelin-1 and endothelin-3.
 The mean concentrations of endothelin-1 and endothelin-3 in simultaneously collected plasma were significantly (P less than 0.01) higher than those in CSF, while there was no significant difference between the mean big endothelin-1 concentration in plasma and that in CSF.
 There was no significant correlation among concentrations of big endothelin-1, endothelin-1, and endothelin-3 in each paired sample.
 These results indicate that endothelin is present in human CSF that is differently processed from endothelin in vascular endothelial cells and suggest a possible role for endothelin as a modulator of neuronal functions.

"Early and late tamponade with the Novacor left ventricular assist system.
 Cardiac tamponade can be a major complication after implantation of the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS).
 Between 1987 and 1989, 14 patients received an LVAS as a bridge to cardiac transplantation: 3 developed early tamponade (33 +/- 12 hr postoperatively) and 5 were diagnosed with a late tamponade (9.4 +/- 3.2 days postoperatively).
 One patient had both early and late tamponade.
 Early tamponade was more common in those with increased perioperative blood loss (5,270 +/- 1,942 ml vs.
 1,420 +/- 1,160 ml in other patients, p less than 0.05).
 Early tamponade was suggested by reduction in mean arterial pressure (74 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 3 mmHg), LVAS output (5 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 L/min), LVAS stroke volume (55 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 5 ml), and an increase in central venous pressure (13 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 mmHg, p less than 0.05 for all values).
 Late tamponade was associated with a marked rise in central venous pressure (14 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.05), with only a mild decrease in LVAS output (4.9 +/- 1 to 3.8 +/- 0.9 L/min) and stroke volume (49 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 3 ml), without a significant change in mean arterial pressure.
 Two of these five late episodes occurred in patients who were anticoagulated with heparin (PTT 52 and 100 sec), and in one other with warfarin (PT 27 sec, PTT 55 sec); two patients were not on any anticoagulants.
 Surgical drainage of pericardial effusions, and especially of clotted blood found frequently posterior to the left ventricle in the space created by the LVAS decompressed left ventricle, resulted in an immediate return of all hemodynamic measurements to normal in both early and late tamponade.

"Comparison of blood flow assessment between laser Doppler velocimetry and the hydrogen gas clearance method in ischemic intestine in dogs.
 Blood flow of the colon and the ileum was measured before and after intestinal devascularization by laser Doppler velocimetry and the hydrogen gas clearance technique in 10 dogs in order to evaluate the clinical usefulness of laser Doppler velocimetry.
 The submucosal blood flow of the colon and the ileum measured by the hydrogen gas clearance method was significantly decreased, as was the subserosal blood flow of both sites measured by laser Doppler velocimetry.
 There was a linear relationship between the flow values using the two methods both in the colon (r = 0.7192, p less than 0.001) and in the ileum (r = 0.7646, p less than 0.001).
 These data suggested laser Doppler velocimetry may be a useful method to assess the degree of intestinal ischemia because of its noninvasiveness and good correlation with submucosal blood flow by the hydrogen gas clearance technique.

"Increasing incidence of varicella hospitalizations in United States Army and Navy personnel: are today's teenagers more susceptible? Should recruits be vaccinated?
 Hospital records for 10,687 United States Army and Navy adult varicella (chickenpox) admissions were reviewed.
 Annual hospital admission rates for varicella increased more than fourfold in the active-duty army during 1980 to 1988 and more than 18-fold among active-duty navy enlisted personnel during 1975 to 1988.
 Fifty-seven percent of varicella admissions occurred in the most junior military members, aged 17 to 20.
 More than half of the total varicella admissions occurred in personnel with less than a year of military service.
 Multivariate analysis of the navy data confirmed increasing time-related trends of risk, suggesting a national temporal trend of increased varicella susceptibility in US teenagers and young adults.
 Administering a safe and effective varicella vaccine to army and navy recruits could prevent more than 7260 hospital-bed days during the first year of use.

"The use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to determine lesion site in traumatic facial paralysis.
 Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging has been used to evaluate 20 patients with surgically confirmed facial nerve lesions.
 When the nerve could be seen, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging accurately revealed the lesion site as well as the known extent, which in some cases was not predicted by topognostic testing.
 This technique appears to provide accurate lesion-site testing and may have importance in surgical planning.
 Currently used topognostic tests of facial nerve function are frequently inaccurate and can only determine the most proximal lesion site when there are multiple or extensive lesions.
 The focal nerve enhancement seen in nerve injury, globally increased signal intensity within the temporal bone after trauma, and increased signal intensity within the dura after surgery can occasionally mask nerve lesions and may be confused with tumors.

"Pregnancy outcome after inadvertent ivermectin treatment during community-based distribution.
 Ivermectin is the drug of choice for community-based treatment of onchocerciasis.
 Since pregnancy testing during mass distribution campaigns is not feasible, the safety of ivermectin in pregnancy must be established.
 During a 3-year study, ivermectin was distributed to the population of a rubber plantation (14,000 people) in Liberia.
 Only 31% of women were aware of their pregnancy status during the first month; it was calculated that about half of women in the first trimester of pregnancy are likely to be treated inadvertently.
 203 children born to women inadvertently treated during pregnancy were identified.
 In this limited sample, there was no significant difference in birth defects between treated and untreated mothers in the same population or compared with a reference population.
 Children of treated and untreated mothers showed no difference in developmental status or disease patterns.
 Further surveillance is necessary; however, since no major effects of ivermectin on pregnancy outcome were detected, there seems no need to change existing strategies of ivermectin distribution.

"Humoral factors determining the blood pressure response to converting enzyme inhibition and calcium channel blockade.
 Renin and catecholamine levels were determined in patients with mild to moderate hypertension before and after treatment with sustained release diltiazem or captopril and were correlated with the blood pressure response to these antihypertensives.
 Eight weeks of treatment with either agent led to equal decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
 Pretreatment plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma norepinephrine did not predict the blood pressure response to either agent.
 Diltiazem significantly increased both PRA and supine norepinephrine levels.
 However, in the diltiazem treated patients, there was no correlation between the change in plasma norepinephrine and the change in systolic or diastolic blood pressure.
 In contrast, there was a negative correlation (P less than .05) between the reactive rise in PRA and the decrease in systolic blood pressure.
 Thus, the antihypertensive response to a calcium channel blocker may be determined, in part, by the reactive response of pressor systems.

"Changes in phosphoinositide turnover, Ca2+ mobilization, and protein phosphorylation in platelets from NIDDM patients.
 Enhanced platelet functions have been demonstrated in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 This study evaluated abnormalities in platelet signal transduction in diabetic patients, including turnover of phosphoinositides, mobilization of intracellular Ca2+, and phosphorylation of 20,000- and 47,000-Mr proteins (P20 and P47).
 Washed platelets were obtained from 6 patients with NIDDM whose platelet aggregation rates were abnormally elevated (DM-A group), 11 NIDDM patients with normal platelet aggregation rates (DM-B group), and 8 age-matched healthy control subjects.
 The mass and specific radioactivity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PIP), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidic acid (PA) in 32P-labeled platelets were not different among the three groups.
 Hydrolysis of PIP2, PIP, and PI; accumulation of PA; and phosphorylation of P20 in platelets stimulated by 0.05 U/ml thrombin were significantly increased in the DM-A group compared with the control or DM-B group.
 There was no difference in P47 phosphorylation among the three groups.
 On the contrary, P20 and P47 phosphorylation induced by 50 nM of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, was significantly decreased in the DM-A group.
 Additionally, the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]i) was measured with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2.
 Although the basal [Ca2+]i value was similar in the three groups, the rise in [Ca2+]i induced by 0.05 U/ml thrombin in the presence and the absence of extracellular Ca2+ was significantly higher in the DM-A group than the other groups.

"Hyperkalemia in the elderly.
 Physiologic and pathologic events that occur in patients as they grow older may result in distal renal tubular dysfunction, as well as decreased levels of plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone.
 Such alterations result in a tendency toward hyperkalemia.
 A syndrome termed hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism, associated with hyperkalemia, has been frequently described in elderly patients.
 The common occurrence of hyperkalemia in the elderly may be aggravated by the use of drugs that either further suppress renin and/or aldosterone or interfere with distal tubular potassium excretion.
 Some patients with hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism respond to diuretic therapy.
 The recognition of the possible development of severe hyperkalemia in the elderly patient may avoid serious and even fatal complications of this electrolyte disorder.

"Early detection and treatment of hyperlipidemia: physician practices in Canada.
 We surveyed primary care physicians in Canada to determine their current practices regarding the detection and treatment of hyperlipidemia in asymptomatic adults 20 years of age or more and to determine the role of selected patient characteristics (age, sex and the presence of coronary heart disease [CHD] risk factors) in their management decisions.
 The self-administered questionnaire was completed by 428 of 804 family physicians and general practitioners.
 The proportion of physicians who reported having tested at least 50% of their adult patients varied from 29% to 85% and was related to the number of CHD risk factors present and the patient's age.
 The proportion of respondents who reported starting dietary or drug therapy among patients with a cholesterol level of 6.2 mmol/L or less increased as the number of CHD risk factors increased and was not related to patient age or sex.
 According to the factors examined our results suggest that primary care physicians in Canada select patients for screening and treatment mainly on the basis of CHD risk factors present and that their approach is more conservative than that recommended by the Canadian and US consensus conferences.

 Auras and subclinical seizures usually were identical in EEG appearance, but were distributed differently among patients.
 The subclinical seizures and auras usually had the same origin as complex partial seizures, but did not always reliably indicate complex partial seizure origin.
 Subclinical seizures and auras were of favorable prognostic significance for patients undergoing temporal lobectomy.

"Value of transesophageal echocardiography during repair of congenital heart defects.
 Two-dimensional transesophageal color Doppler echocardiography was employed intraoperatively in 30 children undergoing repair of a variety of simple and complex cardiac malformations.
 There were 16 female and 14 male patients, with a mean age of 9 +/- 3 years (range, 4 to 13 years) and a mean weight of 31 +/- 9 kg (range, 16 to 50 kg), 16 children weighing less than 30 kg.
 A standard, commercially available transesophageal echocardiography probe (5 MHz, 64 elements) was used in all patients without complications.
 Transesophageal echocardiography proved helpful in selecting the surgical approach, in assessing the adequacy of surgical repair, in detecting residual intracardiac shunts, and in allowing uninterrupted monitoring of ventricular performance throughout the procedure.
 Our initial experience suggests that transesophageal echocardiography is a valuable tool to be used in children with congenital cardiac malformations, particularly in those requiring complex intracardiac procedures.
 The amount of information obtained by the surgeon should favor the routine use of transesophageal echocardiography during open heart procedures and stimulate the development of probes to be safely used even in infants and newborns.

 We used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the frequency of silent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections in seronegative high-risk individuals with hemophilia who had been exposed to contaminated blood products more than 3 years previously.
 In a cross-sectional study of a cohort of 57 prospectively followed seronegative hemophiliacs who received multiple transfusions before 1986, HIV-1 proviral DNA was found transiently in only one patient.
 These data suggest that the rate of HIV infection among high-risk antibody negative individuals with hemophilia is very low to absent, in the range of 0% to 2%.
 These findings should provide considerable reassurance to seronegative persons with hemophilia and their sexual partners.

"ACE inhibition improves vagal reactivity in patients with heart failure.
 The deranged autonomic control of heart rate was studied in 34 patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II to III) by examining the carotid sinus baroreflex.
 The carotid sinus baroreceptors were stimulated by graded suction.
 The slope of the regression line between increases in cycle length and the degree of neck suction was taken as an index of baroreflex sensitivity.
 The reflex response is mediated by a selective increase of vagal efferent activity.
 Baroreflex sensitivity therefore represents a measure of vagal reactivity.
 Using multiple regression analysis, baroreflex sensitivity (BS) correlated positively to stroke volume index (SVI) and inversely to plasma renin activity (PRA) and to age: BS = 0.47 SVI - 0.38 PRA - 0.23 age + constant (r = 0.74; p less than 0.0005).
 In addition to digitalis and diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (captopril or enalapril) were given to 16 patients for a mean of 17 +/- 3 days.
 The patients with hemodynamic improvement (group A) exhibited improved baroreflex sensitivity (1.4 +/- 0.4 to 3.6 +/- 1.2 msec/mm Hg; p less than 0.01).
 Baroreflex sensitivity remained unchanged (3.1 +/- 0.8 to 2.4 +/- 1.0 msec/mm Hg; n.s.) in the patients without hemodynamic improvement (group B).
 The increase in reflex sensitivity did not correlate with hemodynamic alterations.
 Baroreflex sensitivity during ACE inhibition (BSD) was only related to the baseline baroreflex sensitivity (BSB): BSD = 2.8 BSB - 0.46 (r = 0.84; p less than 0.005).
 In patients with heart failure, reflex bradycardia decreases with age and with PRA and increases with stroke volume.
 Chronic therapy with ACE inhibitors enhances vagal reactivity in patients with hemodynamic improvement.

"Putative mechanism of blood pressure reduction induced by increases in dietary calcium intake.
 An increase in dietary calcium intake lowers blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats and in some patients with arterial hypertension.
 The mechanisms by which this decrease come about are not clear.
 A membrane-stabilizing effect wrought by an increase in extracellular calcium would appear unlikely, since the increases in extracellular calcium concentration with increased dietary intake are minimal.
 Calcium regulatory hormones may be the mediators, and a cybernetic framework has been suggested.
 Striking defects have been reported in the calcium handling and hormonal household of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 However, a clear cut relationship in terms of a hormonal ""template"" has not yet been identified in prospective experiments.
 Data have been presented to show that increased calcium intake has a direct effect on regulatory areas in the brain.

 Increased calcium intake may induce natriuresis.
 It has been suggested that increased calcium intake helps the ""salt sensitive""; however, prospective studies to this effect have not been presented.
 Increased calcium intake may induce phosphaturia.
 However, the evidence that blood pressure lowering effects are mediated by phosphate depletion are unconvincing.

"Inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in the brain. Suppression of endothelial cell turnover by penicillamine and the depletion of copper, an angiogenic cofactor.
 Microvascular proliferation, a hallmark of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain.
 Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis.
 Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX2 carcinomas.
 By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors were found in the brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT).
 The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, copper staining of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema.
 In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content.
 CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9L gliosarcoma in F-344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content.
 CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes.
 Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain.

 Four subjects had similar increases of CBF when ascending to 3,200 m 3 mo later, indicating the reproducibility of the measurements.
 In nine subjects, ascending from 3,200 to 4,785-5,430 m, CBF increased to 76.4 ISI units, 53% above estimated sea-level values.
 CBF and increases in CBF were similar in subjects with or without AMS.
 In six subjects, CBF was measured before and after therapeutic intervention.
 At 2 h CBF increased 22% (71.3 to 87.3 ISI units) above pretreatment values in three subjects given 1.5 g acetazolamide, while three subjects given placebo showed no change.

"Prediction of postoperative clinical course by autologous tumor-killing activity in lung cancer patients.
 Fifty patients with primary localized lung cancer were tested at the time of surgery for the ability of their lymphocytes to kill autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells, and the assay was evaluated for prognostic significance.
 Peripheral blood lymphocytes of 27 patients (54%) demonstrated significant autologous tumor-killing activity in 6-hour 51Cr-release assays.
 Twenty-three of the 27 patients with autologous tumor-killing activity remained tumor free and survived more than 5 years after curative surgery, while all 23 who were negative for autologous tumor-killing activity relapsed by 18 months after surgery and died within 42 months after surgery.
 The differences in survival curves for the two groups were highly significant (P less than .00003).
 Autologous tumor-killing activity was not correlated with natural killer (NK) cell activity against K562 human myeloid leukemia cells or proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated with autologous, freshly isolated tumor cells in mixed culture.
 There were no differences in total survival between patients with positive results and those with negative results in tests of NK cell activity and autologous mixed lymphocyte-tumor culture reaction.
 These results indicate that autologous tumor-killing activity is a meaningful prognostic indicator and provide evidence for immunological control of tumor growth and metastasis.
 According to our preliminary data, it is unlikely that lung cancer patients who remain tumor free after 60 months of follow-up will develop recurrence or die from the disease.
 We are conducting a study to determine whether induction of autologous tumor-killing activity before surgery, by treatment with biological response modifiers,can improve the clinical outcome in patients who do not naturally have this potential.

"HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
 We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa.
 Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique.
 Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only.
 Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%.
 Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%.
 Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors.

"Primary hyperparathyroidism and severe hypercalcemia with low circulating 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
 We report a postmenopausal woman with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and severe hypercalcemia while her total calcium intake was more than 2 g daily.
 Despite a markedly elevated intact PTH level, her serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25-(OH)2D] level was low (17 pmol/L; 7 pg/mL).
 With reduced calcium intake, her serum calcium normalized, and 1,25-(OH)2D increased to 122 pmol/L (51 pg/mL).
 At the same time, intact PTH decreased to 32% of the initial value.
 PHPT may be associated with low circulating 1,25-(OH)2D levels.
 Furthermore, low 1,25-(OH)2D levels in PHPT may be due to a direct effect of severe hypercalcemia and be reversible with correction of hypercalcemia.

"Bcl-2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death.
 The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.
 The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein.
 Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling.
 Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation.
 By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k).
 Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line.
 Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.

"Maxillofacial surgery and nasal CPAP. A comparison of treatment for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome 
 Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the primary therapy for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).
 Recent reports have indicated, however, that there is a small but significant number of failures related to patient compliance.
 Primary surgical treatment, which has been uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP), has declined because of poor results.
 A reviewed of UPPP failures has shown that while UPPP eliminated palatal obstruction, it failed to eliminate base of tongue obstruction.
 Maxillofacial surgery has been reported as treatment of OSAS by correcting base of tongue obstruction.
 Thirty patients with severe OSAS were evaluated to compare nasal CPAP and maxillofacial surgery.
 The goal was to determine if our surgical protocol was as effective as nasal CPAP.
 All patients initially underwent baseline diagnostic polysomnography to document OSAS.
 A nasal CPAP study was performed to determine the appropriate positive end-expiratory pressure.
 The patients in this study were using nasal CPAP, but they found it unacceptable as long-term treatment and elected surgery.
 Maxillofacial surgery consisted of maxillary, mandibular, and hyoid advancement.
 Polysomnography was performed six months following surgery and compared with the night 2 CPAP results.
 The parameters included in the investigation were the respiratory disturbance index (RDI), lowest SaO2, number of SaO2 falls below 90 percent, total sleep time (TST), REM sleep percent, stage 3-4 sleep percent, and wake after sleep onset.
 The mean RDI before treatment was 72.0 (SD 25.7).
 After completing therapy, the RDI from surgery and CPAP was 8.8 (SD 6.0) and 8.6 (SD 4.1), respectively.
 The mean low SaO2 prior to treatment was 61.0 (SD 13.5), and the CPAP results and postsurgical results were 86.2 (SD 5.5) and 86.1 (SD 4.2), respectively.
 An analysis of variance was used to examine the results, and there was no statistical difference between nasal CPAP and surgery for all respiratory variables.

"Diabetes, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia in small aboriginal community in northern Australia.
 A small rural Aboriginal community in northern Australia was surveyed for diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), hyperinsulinemia, and lipid levels.
 Of the 122 adults greater than 17 yr of age who participated (95% response rate), 11.5% had diabetes, 7.4% had IGT, and the remaining 81.1% had normal glucose tolerance.
 Both diabetes and IGT were strongly age related.
 This high frequency of diabetes occurred, despite the population being relatively lean.
 Although the body mass index (BMI) increased with age in both men and women, only 25% of the population overall had BMI greater than 25 kg/m2.
 There were wide ranges of insulin responses to glucose, with the upper tertile of 2-h insulin levels being more than seven times higher than the lower tertile (144 +/- 13 vs.
 19 +/- 1 mU/L).
 Hyperinsulinemia was associated with IGT, elevated triglycerides, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.
 Lipid abnormalities were much more frequent among men than women.
 Cholesterol levels were an average of 0.55 mM higher and triglycerides an average of 1.05 mM higher in men than in women, and both increased with age.
 In conclusion, this small isolated Aboriginal population from northern Australia had an unexpectedly high frequency of diabetes (in view of their relative leanness) in association with a high frequency of metabolic abnormalities indicative of insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemia, IGT, hypertriglyceridemia).

"Additional salutary hemodynamic effects of the combined use of the paraaortic counterpulsation device and intraaortic balloon pump versus a paraaortic counterpulsation device alone.
 The hemodynamic effects of the combined use of the paraaortic counterpulsation device (PACD) (stroke volume 65 ml) implanted on the ascending aorta, and a 20 ml intraaortic balloon pump (IABP) placed in the descending aorta, were compared with the PACD working alone in 12 dogs after the induction of heart failure.
 Heart failure was characterized by left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) greater than 18 mmHg and systolic aortic pressure (SAP) in stage A: 116 mmHg greater than or equal to SAP greater than 70 mmHg; in stage B: 70 mmHg greater than or equal to SAP greater than 30 mmHg; and in stage C: SAP less than or equal to 30 mmHg.
 Both modalities of mechanical assistance produced significant salutary hemodynamic effects in stages A and B.
 No difference was observed in stage C.
 In conclusion, the combined use of PACD and IABP is more effective than the use of either of these devices alone.
 This modality of mechanical assistance may easily be applied in patients that cannot be weaned from extracorporeal circulation, and in whom IABP was unsuccessfully applied.

"Stunned myocardium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 The ""stunned myocardium"" is a syndrome of reversible myocardial dysfunction that may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals.
 This phenomenon has been seen in some neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 We performed echocardiograms and measured creatine phosphokinase isoenzymes and lipid peroxide levels in 16 neonates before, during, and after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
 Infants who developed stunned myocardia by echocardiography did so shortly after initiation of bypass and exhibited concurrent elevations of the MB fraction of creatine phosphokinase.
 Lipid peroxide levels did not simultaneously rise.
 These data suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals may not cause the stunned myocardium seen in neonates undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

"Impaired production of tumor necrosis factor in breast cancer.
 Spontaneous and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by peripheral blood macrophages was investigated in breast cancer.
 Whereas spontaneous TNF production by macrophages derived from patients with breast cancer was comparable with the one found in healthy controls (P greater than 0.1), LPS-stimulated macrophages derived from patients in the disease-free interval as well as with metastatic breast cancer were found to produce significantly lower amounts of TNF, as compared with macrophages derived from healthy control individuals (P less than 0.0005).
 However, the production of TNF did not significantly differ between the two patient populations (P greater than 0.05).
 The impairment of LPS-induced TNF production did not depend upon such characteristics of the primary tumor as size, axillary lymph node and estrogen receptor status, or upon the fact of administration of adjuvant chemotherapy and, in patients with metastatic disease, hormone treatment.
 To further investigate cytokine production by macrophages, spontaneous and LPS-induced interleukin-1 (IL-1) production was investigated also.
 However, no difference was found between patients and controls concerning IL-1 generation.
 The authors thus conclude that LPS-induced TNF production was impaired in breast cancer independent of the presence of detectable metastatic disease, whereas IL-1 production remained unimpaired.

"Ultrasonography in the differentiation of complicated and uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis.
 Differentiation of uncomplicated pyelonephritis versus complicated pyelonephritis has always been problematic.
 No clear physical signs or symptoms are diagnostic.
 To study differences between the two, we retrospectively reviewed charts of patients admitted to Charity Hospital, New Orleans, with febrile urinary tract infections.
 Criteria for inclusion were pyuria, positive urinary culture, and signs or symptoms of pyelonephritis.
 All patients underwent renal ultrasonography (US) before other diagnostic tests.
 US identified a potential emergency (hydronephrosis or abscess) in 11 of 98 patients (11.2%).
 The only significant contributing factor was the presence of diabetes mellitus, which was present in five of 11 emergent conditions and eight of 73 of the remainder (P = 0.003).
 US is inexpensive, easily obtainable in the emergency room, and sensitive enough to screen patients with pyelonephritis for complications.
 However, we believe it is mandatory in diabetics, because of the high incidence of abnormalities in this population.

 An increase in labeling efficiency allowed more accurate determination of the distribution of injected Ivalon particles.
 Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the stability of the Ivalon particles during this new labeling process.
 Two patients with arteriovenous malformations underwent therapeutic embolization with radiolabeled Ivalon particles; gamma camera imaging of the lesion and chest was performed throughout the procedure.

"Evaluation of women with possible appendicitis using technetium-99m leukocyte scan.
 The authors evaluated the use of technetium-99m albumin colloid white blood cell (TAC-WBC) scan in women with possible appendicitis.
 One hundred and nine women underwent 110 TAC-WBC scans.
 One woman had a second scan on a separate admission and was considered two individual patients in the analysis.
 Twenty-six women had appendicitis, 10 of whom had a perforated appendix at surgery.
 The TAC-WBC scan was indeterminate (abnormal but nondiagnostic for appendicitis) in 52 women (47%), nine of whom had appendicitis.
 Fifty-eight scans were read as positive or negative for appendiceal pathology.
 There were 16 true positives, 5 false positives, 36 true negatives, and 1 false negative.
 The predictive value of a positive scan was 76%, and the predictive value of a negative scan was 97%.
 The TAC-WBC scan was positive in 62% of patients with appendicitis and negative in 43% of the patients without appendicitis resulting in an overall accuracy of 47% in the 109 women.
 The main value of TAC-WBC scan in women with possible appendicitis is its high negative predictive value and the main problem with the TAC-WBC scan is its high indeterminate rate.

"DNA analysis of multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas.
 The authors used retrospective quantitative DNA analysis to study interrelationships between multiple synchronous renal cell carcinomas in seven patients.
 DNA content was determined by image analysis on Feulgen-stained nuclear smears prepared from multiple paraffin blocks from each tumor.
 Tumors were unilateral in four cases and bilateral in three.
 Ten tumors had homogeneous, and four heterogeneous DNA stemlines.
 Intertumoral heterogeneity in four cases suggested multifocal origin.
 Identical DNA aneuploid indices in bilateral tumors in one case suggested metastasis from a solitary origin.
 Abnormal DNA content and heterogeneous populations began to appear in the size range 2.0 to 5.0 cm.
 All tumors over 5.0 cm contained nondiploid populations.
 Although the interrelationships between these multiple synchronous neoplasms are not entirely clear, the DNA analysis suggests that the occurrence of nondiploid stemlines and heterogeneous DNA content may parallel both tumor growth and more aggressive behavior.

 Patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck are treated with cisplatin and fluorouracil according to a schedule based on the findings of clinical studies.
 A similar schedule showed a supra-additive effect in the treatment of xenografted human squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
 We sought to ascertain whether this schedule was optimal.
 A single intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (7.5 mg/kg) was combined with three injections of fluorouracil given during a 24-hour period (total dose, 150 or 80 mg/kg) before, during, or after cisplatin administration.
 The combined effect of cisplatin and fluorouracil on tumor growth and toxic effects was schedule dependent.
 Consideration of both toxic effects and tumor growth inhibition, as assessed by reduction of the area under the growth curve, the optimal administration interval was found to be fluorouracil given 3 days after cisplatin administration.

"Esophageal 24-h pH monitoring: is prior manometry necessary for correct positioning of the electrode?
 In 24-h esophageal pH monitoring, the electrode is usually positioned 5 cm above the manometrically localized esophagogastric junction.
 In order to replace esophageal manometry for this purpose, we tested whether the esophagogastric junction can be identified correctly by fluoroscopy or the determination of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus, compared with esophageal manometry.
 The distance from the nares to the esophagogastric junction was determined three times with each of the three methods in 46 patients and 14 volunteers.
 Fluoroscopy assumed the esophagogastric junction 1.23 +/- 0.23 cm (mean +/- SE) lower than the peak pressure point determined at manometry, pH-step only 0.45 +/- 0.16 cm.
 With pH-step, only one subject had a difference of more than 3 cm to the manometrically defined esophagogastric junction, whether gastroesophageal reflux disease (as proven by pH monitoring) was present or not.
 We conclude that the esophagogastric junction can usually be identified with sufficient accuracy by the measurement of the pH-step between stomach and esophagus.
 Fluoroscopy is far less accurate than pH-step, and should not be used.

 The effect of immunosuppression on the humoral immune response to islet autoantigens and exogenously administered insulin and the predictive value of islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies (ICAs), insulin antibodies (IAs), and HLA-DR phenotype for remission during immunosuppression were studied in a prospective randomized double-blind trial of cyclosporin administration in 98 newly diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) patients.
 HLA-DR phenotype and glycosylated hemoglobin were determined at study entry, and insulin requirement, glucagon-stimulated C-peptide, ICAs, and IAs were measured at entry and after 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo of follow-up.
 Cyclosporin therapy caused significant suppression of the prevalence and serum concentrations of ICAs and IAs.
 Cyclosporin-treated IDDM patients ICA+ at study entry had higher levels of stimulated C-peptide after 1 mo of study, but the increased beta-cell function was not associated with a higher frequency of insulin-free remission at 1 mo.
 ICA and IA status at entry did not predict cyclosporin-insulin-free remission as assessed by the prevalence of insulin-free remission or beta-cell function at 3-12 mo of study, and significant decrements in the titers or total disappearance of ICAs were not associated with an increased prevalence or duration of non-insulin-requiring remission or higher stimulated C-peptide values.
 There was no correlation between the serum levels of ICAs and IAs at entry and beta-cell function at 12 mo of follow-up.

 The aim of the present investigation was to study the effects of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (TEA), including the cardiac sympathetic segments, on ischemic ST-segment changes and left ventricular global and regional wall motion abnormalities.
 Ten patients with a two- or three-vessel coronary artery disease, all treated with the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol because of severe stable angina pectoris, performed two identical exercise stress tests, the first without TEA (control exercise) and the second with TEA (TEA exercise).
 Before each stress test, intravenous metoprolol was given to achieve maximal or near maximal beta-adrenoceptor blockade.
 Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (radial artery cannula), heart rate, and rate-pressure product, as well as global and regional ejection fractions, using equilibrium radionuclide angiography in the left anterior oblique projection, were measured at rest and during maximal exercise.
 ST-segment analysis (V3 or V5) was performed, and the regional wall motion score was calculated at control exercise and TEA exercise.
 Intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus TEA at rest did not cause any significant changes of any of the variables.
 During TEA exercise, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, and rate-pressure product, but not heart rate, were significantly lower compared to control exercise.
 The global and anterolateral ejection fractions were significantly higher (52.8% versus 46.5% and 53.2% versus 46.0%, respectively, P less than 0.05), and the regional wall motion score was significantly lower (8.8 versus 11.8, P less than 0.01) during TEA exercise than during control exercise.

 Cases of alcoholic cirrhosis identified at necropsy were studied for the prevalence and type of gallstones, compared with age- and race-matched autopsy controls.
 Data were examined from 1970-1977 and 1980-1987.
 In the early sample of 460 cirrhotic patients, 33% had gallstone disease, contrasted with 12% in the controls.
 In the 1980s, among 299 patients, 46% had gallstone disease, whereas it was present in 13% of the controls.
 The prevalence of stones was significantly greater in the patients than in the controls for both time periods and, among the patients, was significantly greater in the 1980s than in the 1970s (p less than 0.05).
 A comparison of cirrhotic patients with and without gallstones indicated a significantly higher incidence of ascites in the patients with gallstones.
 The gallstones in cirrhotics were more frequently pigmented than in the controls in both time periods.
 In 100 living patients with advanced cirrhosis studied by sonography during 1987 and 1989, the prevalence of gallstones was 43%, almost the same as the autopsy sample from 1980-1987.
 In these cirrhotics, ascites, encephalopathy, and varices were more prevalent in the patients with stones than those without.
 We conclude that pigmented gallstones are increasing in cirrhosis of the liver related to the severity of the liver disease.

"Monoclonal antibody to mouse lipopolysaccharide receptor protects mice against the lethal effects of endotoxin.
 Specific endotoxic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding sites on the cell membranes of murine lymphocytes and macrophages that may serve as functional receptors for LPS have recently been identified using photoactivatable cross-linking LPS derivatives.
 A monoclonal antibody (Mab 5D3) with specificity for this 80-kDa protein has also been generated and characterized.
 The capacity of MAb 5D3 to protect mice against the lethal effects of endotoxin was investigated.
 Pretreatment of CF1 mice with as little as 15 micrograms of MAb 5D3 provided virtually complete protection against a dose of endotoxin 10-fold greater than that required to kill all mice in an untreated control group using the galactosamine sensitization model.
 Significant protection was also afforded normal mice given MAb 5D3 relative to saline.
 Several lines of evidence suggest that MAb 5D3-mediated protection is due to the agonist properties of this antibody rather than a receptor blockade mechanism.

 MM3LN tumor-bearing mice exhibited a larger mean survival time.
 The new variant showed a 2.5-fold higher incidence of tumor-draining lymph node metastases than MM3 line, with no differences in the incidence of lung metastases.
 Morphology as well as cytogenetic and in vitro adhesion properties were studied in order to characterize the new subline.
 This murine tumor model has potential application in the study of the metastatic process in lymphoid tissue.

"Histologic evaluation of the width of soft tissue necrosis adjacent to carbon dioxide laser incisions.
 This study evaluated the width of tissue necrosis lateral to carbon dioxide laser incisions on human intraoral excisional biopsy specimens.
 Measurements were made on specimens including epithelium, muscle, dense and loose connective tissue, and salivary gland.
 Results showed a mean width of tissue necrosis of 86 microns in epithelium, 85 microns in muscle, 51 microns in loose connective tissue, 96 microns in dense connective tissue, and 41 microns in salivary gland.
 The range of thermal necrosis in different tissue types is probably based on the water content within each type.
 A cellular partially homogenized zone of reversible thermal damage up to 500 microns in width was visible adjacent to the zone of thermal necrosis.
 The relatively narrow width of tissue necrosis with this technique may account for the claimed superior properties of laser-induced wounds compared with those created by electrosurgery.

"Effect of oral omeprazole on intragastric pH and volume in women undergoing elective caesarean section 
 We have studied in obstetric patients the efficacy of omeprazole in increasing intragastric pH to more than 2.5 and reducing volume to less than 25 ml.
 Omeprazole 40 mg was given orally the night before and again on the morning of surgery to 30 Asian women scheduled to undergo elective Caesarean section.
 After induction of anaesthesia, a gastric tube was inserted and intragastric contents aspirated.
 Volume and pH were recorded and measurements were repeated on completion of surgery.
 The median (range) volume was 2 (1-13) ml before surgery and 4 (0-14) ml at the end of surgery.
 There was insufficient volume to measure pH in all patients.
 The median (range) pH was 6.7 (4.6-7.4) before surgery in 20 patients and 6.6 (4.6-7.8) at the end of surgery in 28 patients.
 No adverse drug reactions were noted in mothers or neonates.
 Omeprazole 40 mg orally twice before elective Caesarean section appeared to be effective in reducing intragastric volume and acidity to acceptable values.

"Contamination of peripheral blood stem cell harvests by circulating neuroblastoma cells.
 Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are being used as one alternative to autologous marrow rescue for patients with neuroblastoma and other solid malignancies.
 Some physicians prefer use of PBSC because less risk of tumor contamination is believed to exist.
 This hypothesis was evaluated by immunocytologic analysis of blood samples and concurrently drawn bone marrow (BM) samples and of PBSC harvests obtained from 31 patients with disseminated neuroblastoma.
 We found circulating neoplastic cells in 75% of specimens analyzed at diagnosis, in 36% during therapy, and in 14% of PBSC harvests.
 Tumor cells in blood obtained during therapy did not appear until 3 months after the time of diagnosis.
 Clearance of circulating neuroblastoma cells was documented after two courses of induction chemotherapy.
 Six of 13 patients with minimal or no BM disease had positive blood specimens.
 We conclude that substantial risk of tumor contamination of PB harvests exists and recommend that induction chemotherapy be administered before hematopoietic progenitor cells are collected from blood.

"Genetic aspects of juvenile chronic arthritis.
 Immunogenetic studies in the past decade have confirmed the theory of an association between one's immunogenetic background and the manifestation of several forms of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), in particular pauciarticular-onset JCA.
 Considerable work has been done at the serologic level to demonstrate disease association with the major histocompatibility Class II antigens in pauciarticular-onset JCA.
 The polygenic nature of JCA is best illustrated by the findings in this particularly well-defined clinical subgroup.
 Evidence is now emerging that analysis of the DNA sequence, the derived protein sequence, and the structure of Class II molecules will yield significant insight into the genetic predisposition to JCA.

"Predicting failure following shunting of pleural effusions.
 We placed 43 shunts in 34 patients in five years.
 Twenty-four had malignant effusions and ten had benign effusions.
 Thirty-one patients had unilateral shunts, three had bilateral shunts and six required revisions for shunt failure.
 Two patients died after shunt placement from disease progression.
 Of the nine patients who experienced poor results, one was noncompliant in operating the shunt and eight had occluded shunts.
 In the 30 patients, who were compliant and had adequate length of follow-up, five had excellent results, 12 had good results, and five had fair results.
 Two of the patients with occluded shunts had good results after shunt revision; 24 patients had some symptomatic relief with shunting.
 Evaluation of factors including a history of prior abdominal surgery, performance status, and pleural fluid cell counts, differential, chemistries, and cytology revealed no significant differences between the patients who experienced shunt failure and those who had patent shunts.
 Shunting of pleural effusions is well tolerated and has good success rates in properly selected patients.

"Predicting distant metastases in operable breast cancer patients.
 Risk factors for distant metastases following mastectomy and axillary node dissection for breast cancer were analyzed in a review of 1022 women.
 From diagnosis until the end of the adjuvant treatment, six stages were identified that corresponded well to patient data acquisition.
 At each stage, a prognosis study based on the Cox model was carried out using all acquired information from the first stage.
 The results demonstrated that tumor size, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic index, and nodal status at the top of axilla were stable independent risk factors in predicting metastasis-free survival (MFS).
 These analyses also revealed those factors that were significantly related to MFS at one or several stages and losing their significance at a subsequent stage.
 This was the case with clinical node status, age, and vascular tumor emboli.
 Other factors such as estrogen, progesterone, histologic grade, and clinical stage were never identified as independent factors at any stage.
 The four major stable risk factors were used to define a stratification of reference.
 The results demonstrated that the mere knowledge of clinical information such as tumor size, clinical node status, and age would enable 51% of the patients to be universally well classified according to that stratification.
 Knowledge of additional factors, such as nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index, would bring the rate up to 61%, and then to 64% if supplementary information such as vascular tumor emboli were acquired.
 These percentages did not appear high enough to claim that the physician may make a reliable prognosis of operable breast cancer patients before acquiring information from the axillary node dissection.
 However, it was proven that there exist some subsets of patients with stable prognosis, i.e., subsets of patients who will belong permanently to the same risk group through the stages.

"Stroke and its modification in Parkinson's disease.
 Previous studies have not agreed on the incidence of ischemic stroke in persons with Parkinson's disease.
 There are epidemiologic and neurochemical facets of Parkinson's disease that might confer some benefit or protection against ischemic stroke.
 We used a case-control method to determine the lifetime history of ischemic stroke in 200 patients with Parkinson's disease and 200 controls of a similar age range.
 Analysis was also carried out for myocardial infarction as a marker of generalized atherosclerotic disease and for stroke risk factors.
 The cumulative incidence of ischemic stroke was significantly less in the patients with Parkinson's disease than in the controls, as was the cumulative incidence of myocardial infarction.
 Among risk factors, significantly fewer patients with Parkinson's disease used tobacco than controls.
 The decreased incidence of ischemic stroke in the patients with Parkinson's disease appears to be related to their less severe generalized atherosclerosis, possibly due to their lower incidence of tobacco use.
 In view of the known potential for dopamine to exacerbate experimental ischemic tissue damage, the possibility that the dopamine deficiency in the central nervous system of persons with Parkinson's disease confers an additional specific protective benefit against ischemic stroke cannot be excluded and requires further study.

"Child abuse of one of a pair of twins in Japan.
 A nationwide survey in Japan on child abuse and neglect revealed that 10% of the victims were products of multiple births.
 None of the victims who were singletons had multiple-birth siblings, and only in a few cases were both twins abused.
 The findings indicated that one rather than both of a pair of twins was likely to be abused in Japan.
 Abuse of both twins was likely when there were serious parental or family problems, whereas abuse of one twin was associated with the child's medical problems or non-home care.
 There was no instance of abuse of a pair of twins when both were handicapped.
 Comparisons of the abused twin with the non-abused co-twin and examination of the abuser's attitude to the victim suggested that the difference between twins in their development or in their response to parents increased the stress of child-rearing and encouraged favouritism, which resulted in abuse of only one twin.
 Comparison by parents of children with their siblings may be a common factor in general child abuse because it is a natural thing for parents to do.

"Physiology and pharmacology of cardiovascular catecholamine receptors: implications for treatment of chronic heart failure.
 In the sympathetic nervous system the physiologic effects of the endogenous catecholamines noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) are mediated by alpha- and beta-adrenoreceptors (ARs).
 Both AR-types can be subdivided into two major subtypes: alpha-ARs into alpha-1 (predominant effect: vasoconstriction) and alpha-2 (presynaptic: inhibition of NA-release; postsynaptic: vasoconstriction), beta-ARs into beta-1 (cardiac effects, renal renin release, and lipolysis) and beta-2 (presynaptic: facilitation of NA-release; postsynaptic: vascular, bronchial, and uterine smooth muscle relaxation, glycogenolysis and possibly part of the A-mediated cardiac effects).
 During the last 30 years growing evidence has accumulated that dopamine (DA), the third endogenous catecholamine and the immediate precursor of NA, may also cause peripheral effects through stimulation of specific DA-receptors, in addition to its known action at alpha- and beta-ARs.
 It is now well accepted that at least two different DA-receptors are present in many peripheral tissues (DA1 and DA2), including those of the cardiovascular and autonomic nervous system.
 They seem to be involved in dilation of certain vascular beds, inhibition of NA-release during nerve stimulation, natriuresis, and aldosterone release.
 In chronic heart failure cardiac beta-AR function decreases (presumably due to endogenous ""down-regulation"" by the elevated catecholamines), and this decrease is related to the severity of heart failure (judged clinically by New York Heart Association functional class).
 The human heart contains both functional beta-1 and beta-2 ARs; cardiac beta-1 and beta-2 ARs seem to be differentially affected by different kinds of heart failure; in end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy beta-1 ARs are selectively reduced, whereas beta-2 ARs are nearly normal.

"Cytotoxic effects of high energy shock waves in different in vitro models: influence of the experimental set-up.
 High energy shock waves (electromagnetically generated, Siemens Lithostar) were studied for their effects in vitro on different (tumor) cell types.
 Cells were exposed to the shock waves as a single cell suspension or as a cell pellet on the bottom of a test tube.
 In both cases, a dose dependent direct cytotoxicity, established by trypan blue dye exclusion, was observed after treatment with 1000 or 2000 shock waves.
 Also, the antiproliferative capacity as determined by clonogenic potential (double layer soft agar) and growth rate (plastic) were affected in this way.
 However, comparing the results after treatment in suspension or pellet, a discrepancy was evident.
 The cell lines showed a different susceptibility in pellet vs.
 suspension.
 Also the differential sensitivity of the cell types varied in these two treatment models.
 Furthermore the outcome depended on the cell concentration; direct cytotoxicity in a cell suspension was more pronounced at higher cell concentrations, while in a pellet this was increased by decreasing the number of cells.
 Finally, no shock wave induced cytotoxicity could be seen after fixation of cells in gelatine or by placing the pellet on a bottom layer of gelatine.
 Pressure measurements revealed no adequate explanation for this phenomenon.
 These results indicate that in vitro effects depend on the way cells are exposed to the shock waves and can be greatly influenced by changing the conditions of the microenvironment.
 Therefore, precise descriptions of the experimental set-up and careful interpretations of their outcome are obligatory.

"Effects of individually motivating smoking cessation in male blue collar workers.
 Adverse demonstrable health effects linked to the individual's smoking were shown to 2,689 American workers to motivate cessation during routine examinations to detect asbestosis.
 This intervention was evaluated six to 25 months later by a mailed questionnaire and by telephone to non-responders.
 Results were compared to yearly quit rates of 2.5 percent to 5 percent for 736 workers who were ex-smokers at the initial examination.
 Of the 504 men who responded by mail, 29.8 percent had quit smoking, 35.9 percent had cut down from a mean of 28 to 13 cigarettes per day, and 34.3 percent were smoking as before.
 Subsequent follow-up at one year showed that 25.6 percent remained quit, and that 23 percent of those who cut down had quit, for an overall quit rate of 34 percent.
 Of 101 non-responders contacted by telephone, 17 percent had quit and 53 percent had reduced smoking.
 In both samples, those who quit were more likely to have had lower alveolar carbon monoxide (COa) levels, to be older, and to have had asbestosis.
 Responders by mail were the same age as non-responders but had smoked longer, had higher prevalences of asbestosis, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and higher COa.
 Demonstration of the adverse personal effects of smoking appear to have contributed to the quit rates or reduced smoking rates in 65 percent of the responding workers.

"IgG antibodies from patients with bullous pemphigoid bind to localized epitopes on synthetic peptides encoded by bullous pemphigoid antigen cDNA.
 Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized in part by the presence of tissue-bound and circulating antibodies specific for basement membrane zone proteins, the BP Ag.
 The purpose of the present study was to determine seroreactivity of patients with BP to six nonoverlapping synthetic peptides representing sequences in the carboxyl domain of the recently cloned 230-kDa BP Ag.
 Sera from 40 patients with BP, 57 normal subjects, and 18 patients with other autoimmune blistering skin diseases were examined in an ELISA for binding to six synthetic peptides varying between 17 and 19 amino acids in length.
 The binding of IgG from patients with BP to three synthetic peptides, P1-2, P1-1, and P3-1, was significantly different from that seen in the normal controls (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test).
 Affinity-purified anti-P1-2 antibody from a patient with BP bound in a characteristic linear band to the epidermal side of 1 M NaCl split skin and immunoprecipitated the native 230-kDa BP Ag.
 Serum IgG antibodies from a rabbit immunized with a BP fusion protein that contains the sequences for P1-1 and P1-2, bound on ELISA to P1-2 but not to P1-1.
 These data suggest that multiple epitopes on the 230-kDa BP Ag are recognized by circulating autoantibodies in patients with this disease, and that an epitope encoded within the synthetic peptide P1-2 is expressed on the native molecule and may be relevant in the generation of an immune response both in man and in an animal model.

 A photocontact dermatitis developed in three patients after the application of gel containing 0.5% piroxicam.
 Patch tests were positive to thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid.
 Photopatch tests with piroxicam at several concentrations were positive in the three patients but negative in 62 normal volunteer subjects.
 Patch tests performed on 14 patients with proved systemic photosensitivity to piroxicam were positive for thiomersal and thiosalicylic acid.
 Nine of 12 patients previously sensitized to thiosalicylic acid and with no history of exposure to piroxicam showed positive photopatch test reactions to this chemical.
 These results support a relation between piroxicam-induced photosensitivity and contact sensitivity to thiosalicylic acid.
 Contact allergic sensitivity to the latter is a marker for patients with a high risk of developing photosensitivity reactions to piroxicam.
 These reactions may be due to photoproducts of the drug rather than metabolites.

"Frequency of myocardial indium-111 antimyosin uptake after uncomplicated coronary artery bypass grafting.
 The reported incidence of myocardial damage after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is highly related to the methods used.
 Since indium-111 monoclonal antimyosin antibody scintigraphy has been shown to be highly specific and sensitive for myocardial necrosis, even in small lesions, uptake of this radiotracer was evaluated after CABG.
 In 23 consecutive patients without previous myocardial infarction who underwent CABG for stable angina, 80 MBq indium-111 antimyosin was injected on the third postoperative day.
 Planar images were obtained 48 hours later and analyzed for myocardial uptake of indium-111 antimyosin.

 Sixty-eight cutaneous squamous cell neoplasms (in situ and invasive) and 26 basal cell carcinomas from 89 patients were analyzed for DNA sequences homologous to the human papillomavirus (HPV) types found predominantly in the genital tract.
 Thirty-six (53%) of the squamous cell neoplasms contained HPV DNA as detected by filter or in situ hybridization analysis.
 The frequency of detection of HPV DNA was dependent on the site of the lesion.
 Of 40 genital squamous cell neoplasms (penile, vulvar, and perianal), 27 (68%) had detectable HPV DNA.
 In 25 of these, the HPV type was 16 or HPV-16-related, which was similar to the results for the squamous cell neoplasms of the finger (HPV DNA in 9 of 11 tumors with HPV-16 in seven).
 None of 16 squamous cell neoplasms from sites other than the genital tract or the finger had detectable HPV DNA.
 HPV DNA was detected in one of the 26 basal cell carcinomas (4%).
 We conclude that, for cutaneous epithelial malignancies, HPV-16 is restricted to squamous cell neoplasms of the genital tract and finger.
 These data are consistent with venereal transmission of HPV-16 to the periungual region and suggests a role for this virus in the evolution of squamous cell carcinoma at this site.

"On the metallothionein, glutathione and cysteine relationship in rat liver.
 Stress and starvation increased liver metallothionein (MT) and decreased liver glutathione (GSH) levels.
 Serum cysteine plus cystine levels were increased by stress.
 The exogenous administration of GSH, while not modifying hepatic GSH content, increased liver MT levels in basal and starved rats but not in stressed rats.
 Liver and serum cysteine levels were increased by GSH administration, a process partially reverted by the irreversible inhibitor of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alpha-amino-3-chloro-4,5-dihydro-5-isoxazoleacetic acid.
 Mouse and rat liver MT levels were also increased by buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis, indicating that GSH is not a necessary precursor of MT.
 In addition, the hepatic MT content was increased by the administration of cysteine in a dose-response manner.
 These results suggest that hepatic MT synthesis is elevated by increased cysteine pools, and that MT, GSH and cysteine levels are somehow inter-related.
 MT, besides GSH, may be contemplated as a putative intracellular reservoir of cysteine in the liver of adult rats.

"Contact allergy due to colophony (VI). The sensitizing capacity of minor resin acids and 7 commercial modified-colophony products.
 3 minor resin acids and 7 commercial modified-colophony products of different origins were studied by experimental sensitization by means of a modified FCA method.
 All 3 resin acids were almost negative.
 The commercial products gave different results.
 While the maleic-modified product of Greek origin showed a strong sensitizing power, the fumaric-modified, terpene-phenol-modified and a disproportioned rosin were only moderate.
 A remarkable difference was obtained with the Swedish and Finnish tall oil rosins, which, in contrast to the previously studied French product, exhibited only a weak sensitizing capacity.

"Distribution and specific identification of papillomavirus major capsid protein epitopes by immunocytochemistry and epitope scanning of synthetic peptides.
 Monoclonal (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies were produced against the major capsid protein of detergent-disrupted, purified bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1).
 The precise locations of the corresponding epitopes were identified by the reactivity of MAbs and selected polyclonal antibodies with synthetic, overlapping, hexameric peptides corresponding with 95% of the BPV-1 major capsid protein.
 The topography of these epitopes was determined by reactivity of antibodies with intact (conformational and nonconformational surface epitopes) and disrupted (external or internal nonconformational epitopes) BPV-1 virions.
 The distribution of epitopes in various papillomaviruses of 13 different species was determined by reactivity of the MAbs and polyclonal sera with productively infected, formalin-fixed papillomas, fibropapillomas, and fibromas.
 Epitope scanning, using MAbs and polyclonal antisera, resulted in the precise location of BPV-1 hexameric epitopes that could be correlated with their topography on the capsid and distribution in papillomatous lesions of various species.

"Endemic Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia infections in a Thai orphanage.
 We conducted a point prevalence survey for enteric protozoa in 205 institutionalized orphans 1-61 months of age in Bangkok, Thailand.
 Cryptosporidium was identified in 17 children (8%), Giardia lamblia in 42 (20%), and 3 children (1%) had both parasites.
 At the time of diagnosis, diarrheal symptoms were present in a minority of subjects: 36% of children with Cryptosporidium alone, 10% with G.
 lamblia alone, and in 20% of those with neither parasite.
 Although chronic nutritional status (height/age) was similar in all groups, acute nutritional status (weight/height) was lower only in children with Cryptosporidium (Z score = -1.39 +/- 0.13) compared with children with G.
 lamblia (mean Z score +/- SEM = -0.56 +/- 0.26) or neither parasite (Z score = -0.78 +/- 0.13; P = 0.05).
 Detectable levels of Cryptosporidium-specific IgG antibodies by ELISA were identified in 15 of 16 Thai children with Cryptosporidium and in 17 of 19 Thai children without Cryptosporidium (mean OD +/- SEM = 1.27 +/- 0.18 vs.
 1.06 +/- 0.13, respectively), but in only 1 of 18 sera from toddlers in day-care centers in Denver, CO (OD = 0.128 +/- 0.03).
 Although neither infection with Cryptosporidium nor G.
 lamblia was consistently associated with acute diarrheal symptoms, Cryptosporidium was more often associated with depressed acute nutritional status than G.
 lamblia.
 The high prevalence of specific antibodies to Cryptosporidium in Thai orphans suggests an association between high rates of exposure with asymptomatic excretion of the parasites.

"Characteristics of participants at baseline in the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS).
 The Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS) is a randomized, double-blind clinical trial currently being conducted to compare the effects of nonpharmacologic therapy alone with those of 1 of 5 active drug regimens combined with nonpharmacologic therapy, for long-term management of patients with mild hypertension.
 Six classes of drugs were studied: (1) acebutolol (beta blocker), (2) amlodipine (calcium antagonist), (3) chlorthalidone (diuretic), (4) doxazosin (alpha 1 antagonist), (5) enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) and (6) placebo.
 All participants received nutritional-hygienic advice to reduce weight and sodium and alcohol intakes and to increase physical activity.
 End points include blood pressure change, side effects and quality-of-life indices; incidence of electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities; and incidence of cardiovascular clinical events, including death, among participants receiving drugs as first-step treatment as well as nonpharmacologic treatment compared with incidence among those participants randomized to nonpharmacologic treatment only as the initial step.

"Mucosal thickening on sinus X-rays and its significance.
 Mucosal thickening is commonly seen on X-rays of the paranasal sinuses taken in the ENT department.
 This sometimes leads to a sinus washout, which is clear, even though the X-rays were strongly suggestive of disease.
 This paper examines the prevalence of sinus X-ray anomalies in a general population, having facial X-rays for conditions other than possible sinus disease.
 The study suggests that up to 50 per cent of the so-called normal population may have sinus X-ray appearances consistent with sinus disease, and this may partly explain clear returns on sinus washout.

"William Glenn lecture. The cavopulmonary shunt. Evolution of a concept.
 A bold and imaginative development, the cavopulmonary anastomosis, appeared to originate in several centers almost simultaneously.
 After extensive research on right heart bypass, Glenn was the first in North America to perform a successful experimental cavopulmonary shunt, and it became known by his name.
 In properly selected patients, palliation success was excellent, and mortality rates were low.
 From 1961 through 1988, we used a cavopulmonary anastomosis for palliation in 139 infants and children.
 There were eight hospital deaths, and most occurred early in the series.
 Palliation generally lasted 6-8 years-until the child outgrew the blood supply to the contralateral lung.
 Palliation could be restored by increased flow to that lung with another shunt.
 Six otherwise inoperable patients received benefit from the addition of an axillary arteriovenous fistula.
 Late pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas were identified in 11% of our patients by angiography, but with more sensitive testing, the incidence rate may be as high as 21%.
 The occurrence of pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas caused general concern and less frequent use of the shunt.
 Recent application of an end-to-side anastomosis, creating a bidirectional shunt, has restored interest.
 A major legacy of the cavopulmonary anastomosis was demonstration of the feasibility of partial right heart bypass, which paved the way for the Fontan operation, and it is frequently constructed as part of that operation.
 Currently, the Glenn shunt is most often used as a temporary or permanent alternative to a Fontan repair if there appears to be significant risk.
 The risk factors usually encountered include small pulmonary arteries, young age, poor ventricular function, atrioventricular valve incompetence, and myocardial hypertrophy-sometimes alone but often in combination.

"Alpha 1-antitrypsin excretion in stool in normal subjects and in patients with gastrointestinal disorders.
 Fecal clearance of plasma alpha 1-antitrypsin is used as a measure of protein leakage into the intestinal tract.
 In this study, the alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration in stool and the plasma clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin in normal subjects and in a consecutive series of patients with chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, or unexplained hypoalbuminemia was determined.
 The normal subjects were studied in their usual state and also when they had diarrhea secondary to ingestion of lactulose, sorbitol, sodium sulfate, or phenolphthalein.
 The study first concluded that induced diarrhea can cause an increase in alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance; if this is not considered in establishing normal values, there may be an overdiagnosis of excess protein leakage in patients with diarrhea.
 Second, there is a highly significant statistical correlation (P less than 0.001) between alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and serum albumin concentration.
 On average, the serum albumin falls below 3.0 g/dL (30 g/L) when the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance exceeds 180 mL/day, a value that is about threefold higher than the upper limit of normal.
 Third, three of nine patients with microscopic/collagenous colitis had elevated clearance of alpha 1-antitrypsin; by contrast, abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was not found in 23 patients with idiopathic secretory diarrhea.
 Fourth, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin concentration is not a reliable index of abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance.

 We have confirmed the observation of Ellis et al.
 that some pigmented lesions possess sex hormone-binding proteins.
 We could not demonstrate a true estrogen receptor in any benign nevi, dysplastic nevi, primary melanomas, or metastatic melanomas.
 Thus the ability to bind estrogen or progesterone does not correlate with the presence of a true estrogen receptor.
 Lack of nuclear estrogen receptors suggests that the influence of estrogen on the pathophysiology of melanoma or of benign melanocytic nevi may not be significant.

 After a failed first cycle, both males and females showed significant increases in anxiety and depressive symptoms.
 Although group means were not clinically elevated and most participants were coping adequately, the prevalence of both mild and moderate depression increased substantially, particularly among women.
 In addition, women without children were a subgroup particularly vulnerable to the stress of failure.

"Spontaneous splenic rupture following infectious mononucleosis.
 Four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been treated at this institution since 1978.
 The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis.
 Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients.
 However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM.
 The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients.
 Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy.
 In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture.
 Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM.
 Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction.

"A multifactorial analysis of mortality and morbidity in perforated peptic ulcer disease.
 Perforated peptic ulcer disease remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality, and the suggested methods of surgical therapy are diverse.
 We reviewed the course of 113 patients who were treated surgically and identified 14 factors that influenced the morbidity or mortality rates, or both.
 Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of coexisting medical conditions, a lower mean blood pressure level and the duration of acute perforation were independent risk factors for death, while age, use of a bronchodilator, a lower mean blood pressure level and the number of coexisting medical conditions correlated positively with all complications.
 A duodenal site was independently favorable with respect to all complications.
 The type of operation performed either simple closure, vagotomy and drainage or resection, did not influence morbidity or mortality.
 The most severely ill patients also did not benefit from any particular type of operation in the short term.
 Long term results were improved with definitive operation, as measured by the Visick classification and the need for reoperations.
 Definitive operations are recommended for virtually all patients with perforated peptic ulcer.

"Endogenous opioids modulate the increase in ventilatory output and dyspnea during severe acute bronchoconstriction.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate whether endogenous opioids are involved in the regulation of breathing pattern and respiratory drive during bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh).
 We studied six male asymptomatic asthmatics 18 to 35 yr of age.
 In a preliminary study we determined the concentration of MCh causing a 60% fall in FEV1 (PC60 FEV1).
 On two subsequent days, we measured breathing pattern, dyspnea sensation (Borg scale), mouth occlusion pressure (P0.1), and FEV1 before and 10 min after an intravenous injection of either naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) or saline according to a randomized double-blind crossover design.
 A MCh concentration equal to the PC60 FEV1 was then inhaled, and measurements were repeated 5 min later.
 Neither placebo nor naloxone affected baseline breathing pattern, P0.1, and FEV1.
 Naloxone pretreatment did not influence airway response to MCh; the mean percent fall in FEV1 was 65.9 +/- 1.3 and 64.7 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- 1 SE) on the placebo day and the naloxone day, respectively.
 After MCh inhalation no significant changes in VE, VT, and breathing frequency occurred when patients received placebo.
 However, P0.1 increased from 1.48 +/- 0.17 to 3.43 +/- 0.70 cm H2O (p less than 0.05), and VT/TI fell from 0.66 +/- 0.08 to 0.52 +/- 0.04 L/s (p less than 0.05).
 Naloxone pretreatment resulted in an increase in breathing frequency (from 18.2 +/- 1.7 to 22.8 +/- 2.6 breaths/min; p less than 0.05) and VT/TI (from 0.58 +/- 0.06 to 0.74 +/- 0.05 L/s; p less than 0.05) after MCh.

"Long-term outcome after surgical repair of isolated atrial septal defect. Follow-up at 27 to 32 years 
 BACKGROUND.
 Atrial septal defects have been surgically correctable for more than 30 years.
 The long-term survival rates among patients treated in the early era of cardiac surgery are poorly documented, but such data are of critical importance to the future medical care, employability, and insurability of these patients.
 METHODS.
 To determine the natural history of surgically corrected atrial septal defects, we studied all 123 patients who underwent repair of an isolated defect (ostium secundum or sinus venosus) at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960, 27 to 32 years after the procedure.
 The follow-up status of all patients was determined by written questionnaires and telephone interviews.
 Hospital records and death certificates were obtained if interim hospitalization or death had occurred.
 RESULTS.
 The overall 30-year actuarial survival rate among survivors of the perioperative period was 74 percent, as compared with 85 percent among controls matched for age and sex.
 The perioperative mortality was 3.3 percent (four deaths).
 Actuarial 27-year survival rates among patients in the younger two quartiles according to age at operation (less than or equal to 11 years and 12 to 24 years) were no different from rates among controls--97 percent and 93 percent, respectively.
 In the two older quartiles (25 to 41 years and greater than 41 years), 27-year survival rates were significantly less (P less than 0.001)--84 percent and 40 percent, respectively--than in controls (91 and 59 percent).
 Independent predictors of long-term survival according to multivariate analysis were age at operation (P less than 0.0001) and systolic pressure in the main pulmonary artery before operation (P less than 0.0027).
 When repair was performed in older patients, late cardiac failure, stroke, and atrial fibrillation were significantly more frequent.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Among patients with surgically repaired atrial septal defects, those operated on before the age of 25 have an excellent prognosis, but older patients require careful, regular supervision.

"Long term survival and severe rebleeding after variceal sclerotherapy.
 Of 197 consecutive patients with cirrhosis admitted because of bleeding from esophageal varices, 133 were included in a prospective study of elective sclerotherapy.
 We evaluated the incidence of extensive rebleeding and mortality rate.
 The period of study was 54 months and the mean follow-up period was 21 months.
 Forty-one patients had severe rebleeding and a majority of the episodes occurred during the first year.
 Only four patients had more than five sessions of sclerosis when rebleeding occurred.
 The probability rate for patients to be free of severe rebleeding after 48 months, according to Pugh's classification, was 88 per cent for those with grade A, 50 percent for grade B and 43 percent for grade C.
 The over-all mortality rate was 38.8 per cent (53 patients), with the highest rate noted during the first year.
 The mortality rate of patients with severe rebleeding was much higher than that of those who did not rebleed.
 Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at four years was 52 per cent, and survival rates in relation to Pugh's classification were 73 per cent for A, 53 per cent for B and 34 per cent for C.
 Differences between the three groups were statistically significant.
 Therefore, because of the high mortality rate associated with patients with cirrhosis and extensive rebleeding during the first year, it is important to achieve, as soon as possible, eradication of esophageal varices.

"Causes of death in hospitalized intravenous drug abusers.
 The authors reviewed at autopsy the causes of death of 274 patients with evidence of intravenous drug abuse who had been admitted to a large public hospital.
 There were 127 who died from diseases unrelated to intravenous drug abuse, and in 41% of these, chronic alcoholism was implicated.
 Deaths from overdose syndromes and drug-related organ pathology comprised only 11% of all cases.
 The mean age at death was 39 years.
 There was a male/female ratio of 3.6:1.
 Half of all patients died from infection--72 from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) alone.
 These findings indicate that persons hospitalized with a history of intravenous drug abuse usually die from causes other than overdose and that AIDS and chronic alcoholism are significant problems.
 Emphasis should be placed upon detecting ""hidden"" intravenous drug deaths to provide more accurate statistical information.

"Another way of pumping blood with a rotary but noncentrifugal pump for an artificial heart.
 This article describes an alternative mode of pumping blood inside the body.
 The device is a non centrifugal, valveless, low speed rotary pump, electrically powered, based on Wankel engine principle.
 The authors developed an implantable electrical actuator resulting in a compact, sealed motor-pump unit with electrical and magnetic components insulated from fluids.
 The results in the flow curve and in the pumping action show some common points but also some basic differences compared to classical pulsatile pumps or centrifugal pumps.
 The blood coming from the atrium follows a continuous movement without any stop flow but with variations creating pulsatility.
 Ejection and filling of the pump are simultaneous.
 It is always an active filling.
 Hydraulic efficiency depends on clearance in the pumping chamber and outlet port pressure.
 A 60 cc device allows flows up to 8-9 liters.
 The implantable motor is cyclindrical in shape, has a moderate weight (490 grams) and presents a good efficiency (32% for a rotary speed of 90 rpm against a mean aortic pressure of 150 mm of Hg).
 The authors conclude that their device could be proposed after further experimental studies, as an LVAD for shortterm assistance with a good promise for permanent application.

"Flow and volume dependence of respiratory system mechanics during constant flow ventilation in normal subjects and in adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 Seven control subjects and seven patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were artificially ventilated and flow, volume, and tracheal pressure were monitored.
 Respiratory system resistance (Rrs,max) was partitioned into its homogeneous (Rrs,min) and uneven (Rrs,u) components.
 Respiratory system elastance (Ers) was also measured.
 In both groups Ers did not vary with different inspiratory flows and volumes, but was significantly higher in ARDS.
 With increasing volume (isoflow maneuvers), Rrs,max and Rrs,u increased but Rrs,min remained unaltered in ARDS.
 In control patients, however, resistances did not vary but Rrs,max and Rrs,u were smaller and Rrs,min equaled their corresponding values in ARDS.
 Hence, stress relaxation seems to be increased in ARDS.
 During isovolume maneuvers Rrs,max and Rrs,u decreased with increasing flows (both groups), although they were significantly higher in ARDS.
 Rrs,min was not modified by different flows and was similar in both groups.
 Thus, pendelluft is also increased in ARDS.
 In conclusion, the mechanical profile of ARDS is characterized by increased Ers and Rrs,max, the latter being secondary to augmented mechanical unevenness within the system.

"History of antifungals.
 Until two to three decades ago, only a few drugs were available for the treatment of fungal infections.
 The status of antifungal therapy changed dramatically in the late 1960s with the introduction of newer broader spectrum agents, such as the iodinated trichlorophenols and the imidazoles, that acted by disruption of the fungal cell membrane.

"Comparison of right ventricular and biventricular circulatory support in a porcine model of right heart failure.
 The effects of right ventricular (RVAD) and biventricular assist devices (BVAD) in an acute porcine model of right heart ischemic failure produced by occluding the right coronary artery for 2 min (RCAO) were compared.
 Right and left ventricular pressures were measured with Millar transducers and respective septal-to-free wall dimensions (RVSFWD, LVSFWD) with ultrasonic crystals.
 RCAO alone resulted in significant right heart failure, marked by a 36 +/- 5% reduction in cardiac output (pulmonary artery flow) and a 54 +/- 16% reduction in RV stroke work.
 Isolated RVAD significantly improved the hemodynamic conditions by restoring pulmonary blood flow and left heart filling to control levels.
 RVAD also resulted in reduced RVSFWD to control levels and increased LVSFWD via a rightward septal shift due to right heart unloading.
 Biventricular support resulted in the same hemodynamic improvement, but estimated LV peak systolic wall stress was reduced by 65 +/- 15% compared with control, due to concomitant LV unloading and reductions in LVSFWD.
 Therefore, either right or biventricular devices are effective in treating RV failure.
 The advantage of biventricular support is that the left ventricle is also unloaded, thus allowing improved circulatory support with minimal LV wall stress.

"Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with dyspeptic symptoms in patients undergoing gastroduodenoscopy.
 PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and ulcer disease as well as in a control population undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected pancreatic or biliary disease.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients undergoing upper endoscopy at Massachusetts General Hospital were studied over a period of 18 months, as well as 24 patients undergoing ERCP for presumed pancreatic or biliary disease.
 Two biopsy specimens from the fundus and two from the antrum were taken for microbiologic and histopathologic analysis.
 Sera were examined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay.
 All specimens were processed in a blind fashion.
 Chi-square test with Yates' correction was used for statistical analysis.
 RESULTS: H.
 pylori was found in 31 of 46 (67%) study patients and in six of 24 (25%) control patients (by microbiologic or histologic techniques) (p less than 0.01).
 H.
 pylori was found in all patients with peptic ulcer disease and in 60% of patients without ulcers.
 No association between H.
 pylori and any specific gastrointestinal symptom was observed.
 H.
 pylori was identified in the fundus as often as in the antrum, although in the antrum the organism was more often associated with histologic gastritis.
 Compared with histology, serologic assays for IgG and IgA antibodies to H.
 pylori had sensitivities of 100% and 94%, and specificities of 86% and 76%, respectively.
 Reexamination of selected specimens without knowledge of their identity revealed that the specificity of serology exceeded 94% while the sensitivity of histologic and microbiologic studies may have been closer to 80%.
 CONCLUSIONS: H.
 pylori was more common in dyspeptic patients than in our control subjects undergoing ERCP.
 Multiple biopsy sites from fundus and antrum are required to exclude infection.
 Serologies of IgG and IgA were sensitive and specific for H.
 pylori, suggesting a possible role for non-endoscopic diagnosis of this infection.
 The frequent association of H.
 pylori with active inflammation rather than with quiescent gastritis is consistent with a pathologic role of this organism.

"Sodium lauryl sulphate for irritant patch testing--a dose-response study using bioengineering methods for determination of skin irritation.
 The dose-response relationship in patch testing with sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS) was studied.
 The irritant skin response was quantified by visual scoring as well as by the following noninvasive methods: measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL) by an evaporimeter, measurement of skin color by a colorimeter, measurement of superficial blood flow by laser Doppler flowmetry, and measurement of edema in the skin by ultrasound A-scan.
 Twelve volunteers were patch tested with 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, and 1.00% SLS, and the skin response was evaluated after 24 and 48 h, respectively.
 We found a statistically significant linear dose-response relationship between dose of SLS and skin response evaluated by measurement of TEWL, skin color, superficial blood flow, and edema.
 Statistical evaluation by regression analysis proved measurement of TEWL to be the method best suited overall for quantification in relation to patch testing with SLS, whereas colorimetry was found to be the least sensitive of the applied methods.
 Ultrasound A-scan was found to be a promising method for quantification of the inflammatory response, being consistently more sensitive than measurement of skin color.

"Cytokine production (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and TNF alpha) and endothelial cell activation (ELAM-1 and HLA-DR) in reactive lymphadenitis, Hodgkin's disease, and in non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. An immunocytochemical study.
 Cryostat sections of 58 lymph nodes were immunostained with a polyclonal rabbit serum against IL-1 alpha, and with monoclonal antibodies directed to IL-1 alpha (Vmp18), IL-1 beta (Vhp20 and BRhC3), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) (B154.7).
 Furthermore the presence of cytokine-containing cells was correlated with the expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM-1; 29F2) and of human leukocyte antigen (HLA-DR) (OKIa-1) by endothelial cells.
 Cells containing IL-1 and/or TNF alpha were detected mainly in pathologic conditions characterized by reactive or neoplastic expansion of the lymph node paracortex.
 Cells positive for IL-1 were detected in 16 of 21 cases of Hodgkin's disease, in 4 of 4 cases of T-NHL, and in 5 cases of diffuse or mixed lymphadenitis.
 Interleukin-1 alpha was detected in macrophages, interdigitating reticulum cells (IDRCs), endothelial cells, and neoplastic Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells.
 Cells positive for IL-1 beta were much fewer and consisted mainly of macrophages.
 Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells were negative for IL-1 beta even after in vitro stimulation with bacterial endotoxin.
 Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) was present in macrophages and H-RS cells.
 Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 expression by endothelial venules was detected in 17 of 20 cases of Hodgkin's disease, in 2 of 4 cases of T-NHL, and in 5 of 5 cases of diffuse lymphadenitis.
 In these pathologic conditions, HLA-DR antigens also were expressed frequently by endothelial cells.
 Cytokine-containing cells and ELAM-1-positive high endothelial venules (HEV) were extremely rare in lymph nodes involved by follicular lymphadenitis (12 cases) or B-NHL (16 cases).
 In cases of reactive or neoplastic B-cell proliferations, HLA-DR-positive HEVs still were present often.
 Our results indicate that IL-1/TNF alpha production at tissue level is often associated with ELAM-1 expression by HEVs, but is less well correlated with expression of HLA-DR antigens by endothelial cells.

"Prevalence of occupational asthma and immunologic sensitization to psyllium among health personnel in chronic care hospitals.
 Psyllium is a high molecular weight laxative that can cause occupational asthma among health care workers who prepare this product for chronically ill patients.
 The prevalence of immunologic sensitization and occupational asthma to psyllium is unknown.
 We investigated the personnel of four chronic care hospitals, including two where four cases of occupational asthma had been confirmed the year preceding the trial.
 A questionnaire and skin prick tests with psyllium and various inhalants were administered to 193 of 248 (78%) of the workers who agreed to participate.
 Seventy-five subjects (39%) had a history of respiratory symptoms in normal life and/or respiratory symptoms and/or rhinoconjunctivitis after handling psyllium.
 Six (3%) showed skin reactivity to psyllium.
 Increased specific IgE antibodies were found in 20 of 162 of the sera that were tested (12%).
 In the second part of the study, a histamine inhalation challenge was performed on 70 of 75 (93%) of the subjects with a history suggestive of asthma and/or occupational asthma and/or skin reactivity to psyllium.
 Twenty (29%) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
 The six subjects with a history suggestive of occupational asthma (n = 3) and/or asthma (n = 6) and/or positive skin test results to psyllium (n = 6) had significant bronchial hyperresponsiveness and increased specific IgE levels.
 They all underwent specific inhalation challenges with psyllium in the laboratory.
 Four developed bronchospastic reactions (two immediate and two dual reactions).
 We conclude that by including the initial four cases reported in the year preceding the initiation of this trial, the prevalence of IgE sensitization to psyllium was between 5 (skin testing) and 12% (increased specific IgE levels).

"The electrocardiogram in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 The electrocardiogram is often abnormal in patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 The most frequent abnormalities are a rightward P-wave axis (greater than or equal to 70 degrees) and a rightward QRS axis (greater than or equal to 90 degrees).
 In addition, low voltage in the limb leads, an S1S2S3 pattern, poor R-wave progression, a posterior-superior terminal QRS vector or other changes may be present.
 Transient atrial and ventricular dysrhythmias are common.
 Knowledge of the usual electrocardiographic manifestations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease enables the clinician to recognize uncharacteristic abnormalities, which often represent the effects of superimposed illnesses or drug toxicity.

"The anatomy and physiology of nerve injury.
 Nerves have a structure of considerable complexity with features of special relevance to nerve injury and nerve regeneration.
 These include variations in the cross-sectional areas devoted to fascicular and epineurial tissue, the fascicular redistribution and mixing of different branch fibers brought about by fascicular plexuses, and the numbers of nerve fibers representing individual branches.
 The elasticity and tensile strength of nerve trunks and their capacity to resist traction deformation reside in the fascicular tissue, while the epineurium provides a protective cushion against compression.
 The microstructure of nerve trunks provides the basis for a classification of nerve injuries into five degrees of severity with partial and mixed types--each with a clearly defined pathology and distinguishing clinical features.
 Following a transection injury, changes occur in the severed axons, endoneurial tubes, fasciculi, and nerve trunk.
 The type of injury and the nature of these changes determine the outcome of axon regeneration.

"Hemodynamic effects of nebivolol at rest and on exertion in patients with heart failure.
 Nebivolol is a novel B-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug with an unusual hemodynamic profile unlike classical B-blockers.
 In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function.
 The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%).
 A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day).
 While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment.
 The stroke volume increased significantly.
 The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed.
 Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate.

"Sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled probes for detection of human papillomavirus by in situ hybridisation.
 The sensitivity of digoxigenin and biotin labelled DNA probes for the detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) by dot blotting and in situ hybridisation was compared in tissues from cervical, laryngeal, and anogenital neoplasia.
 Probes were either labelled with digoxigenin by the random primer technique and detected with anti-digoxigenin antibody, or labelled with biotin by nick translation and detected with streptavidin, both methods having a common final visualisation procedure using alkaline phosphatase.
 Digoxigenin labelled probes proved two to 10-fold more sensitive by quantitative dot blotting and four-fold more sensitive in detecting HPV 16 DNA in a series of 31 anal carcinomas, compared with biotinylated probes.
 The digoxigenin method also produced less non-specific background staining of tissue sections than biotin labelled probes.
 It is concluded that digoxigenin DNA labelling and detection provides a simple, reliable, and efficient alternative to the use of biotin or radioactive isotopes for the detection of HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation.
 Digoxigenin labelled probes also offer the possibility of double labelling in situ hybridisation procedures when used with biotin labelled probes to provide simultaneous identification of different DNA sequences.

"The ""natural history"" of segmental wall motion abnormalities in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. S.P.I. Research Group.
 Intraoperative segmental wall motion abnormalities (SWMA) detected by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) are sensitive, but not always specific, markers of myocardial ischemia.
 To determine their incidence, characteristics, and relation to postoperative cardiac morbidity, we continuously recorded the left ventricular short-axis view and 12-lead ECG in 156 high-risk patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
 Monitoring was clinically blinded.
 Wall motion was scored at predefined clinical, hemodynamic, and ECG events and at periodic intervals (26 +/- 11 samples per patient).
 We detected 44 episodes of new or worsened SWMA in 32 patients (20%).
 The severity of most episodes was limited to severe hypokinesis (24/44, 55%) followed by akinesis (16/44, 36%) and dyskinesis (4/44, 9%).
 The remaining 124 patients had normal wall motion or only mild hypokinesis (56/156, 36%) or chronic SWMA (68/156, 44%).
 The incidence of new SWMA did not differ for patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD) and those with cardiac risk factors only (22% vs.
 19%, P = not significant), although CAD patients had a significantly greater incidence of chronic SWMA (62% vs.
 41%, P = 0.02).
 The incidence of new or worsened SWMA was significantly greater during aortic vascular surgery (38% vs.
 17%, P = 0.05).
 Approximately 40% of all new TEE changes occurred in the absence of either an apparent clinical event or a significant change in systolic blood pressure or heart rate.
 Ten patients had new or worsened SWMA persisting until the end of surgery, 8 with new akinesis, only 1 developing myocardial infarction.
 The distribution of new or worsened SWMA and significant intraoperative ST-T changes (n = 19) in this cohort was discordant: temporal overlap between modalities was present in only 5 patients.
 Major cardiac complications occurred in 5 patients (3.2%), all of whom underwent peripheral vascularization.
 All patients with cardiac complications and new or worsened SWMA also had intraoperative or early postoperative ST-T changes.
 We conclude that: 1) continuous TEE recording with offline analysis in this high-risk group of patients revealed a relatively low incidence of new or worsened SWMA (20%), most episodes of which were characterized by severe hypokinesis (55%); 2) episodes were more common in patients undergoing aortic vascular surgery; 3) approximately 40% of episodes were unaccompanied by clinical events or significant hemodynamic changes; 4) episodes were poorly correlated with postoperative cardiac complications; and 5) the discordant relation between TEE and ECG changes observed here necessitates careful monitoring of the ECG when TEE is used clinically.

"Mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap after resection of carcinoma of the esophagus involving the proximal part of the trachea.
 An operative procedure of mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is presented.
 In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap.
 Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea.
 In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma.
 A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three.
 In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap.
 However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap.
 Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea.

"Lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell activity in B and T chronic lymphoid leukemia: defective LAK generation and reduced susceptibility of the leukemic cells to allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors.
 The capacity to generate lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and the susceptibility of the neoplastic cells to both allogeneic and autologous LAK effectors were studied in B and T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders.
 While in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) the depressed natural killer function could be restored after a 7-day incubation with recombinant interleukin (IL-2), B-CLL mononuclear cells showed a reduced LAK activity compared with normal LAK cells.
 Furthermore, in all but 1 of the 20 B-CLL samples tested the leukemic cells were totally resistant to autologous LAK effectors.
 In most cases the leukemic cells were also resistant to normal allogeneic LAK cells.
 Competition experiments demonstrated that the patients' LAK cells, as well as normal LAK effectors, were capable of recognizing B-CLL cells, pointing, therefore, to a postbinding cytolytic defect.
 In hairy cell leukemia (HCL) an overall reduced LAK activity against allogeneic targets was documented, but, at variance from B-CLL, hairy cells were often susceptible to the lytic effect of normal LAK cells, and in half of the cases tested the neoplastic population was also sensitive in an autologous system.
 Similarly to B-CLL, in the great majority of T chronic lymphoproliferative disorders studied, the pathologic cells were resistant to normal and autologous LAK effectors and a defective LAK generation was found.
 These results demonstrate that in most B and T chronic leukemias the LAK function is defective and, when inducible, does not appear directed against the leukemic population.
 The possibility of exploiting an immunotherapeutic approach with IL-2/LAK cells in the management of chronic lymphoproliferative disorders does not gain support by these findings.

"Ventricular arrhythmias in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy. Relationship to coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction, and myocardial fibrosis.
 Ventricular arrhythmias occur with increased frequency in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).
 The relationships, however, between ventricular arrhythmias and coexistent coronary artery disease, left ventricular dysfunction and left ventricular fibrosis have not been examined in hypertensive LVH.
 We carried out coronary arteriography on fifteen hypertensive patients with LVH and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (greater than or equal to 3 consecutive ventricular complexes) of whom nine (60%) were free of significant (greater than 50% stenosis) coronary disease.
 To identify other possible correlates of left ventricular arrhythmias, 28 patients with LVH, comprising 17 with ventricular tachycardia and 11 without ventricular arrhythmias, underwent quantitative assessment of left ventricular function (angiographic ejection fraction), left ventricular mass (echocardiography), and left ventricular fibrosis (endomyocardial biopsy).
 Ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups (53 +/- 8% v 62 +/- 2%, P = NS).
 However, left ventricular mass was significantly greater (442 +/- 28 g v 339 +/- 34 g, P less than .05) and percentage fibrosis significantly higher (19 +/- 4% v 3 +/- 1%, P less than .001) in those patients with ventricular tachycardia.
 Thus ventricular arrhythmias in hypertensive patients with LVH cannot be entirely attributed to coexistent coronary disease, nor to left ventricular dysfunction, but are related to the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and subendocardial fibrosis.

"Effects of nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, on myocardial salvage and high energy phosphate stores in reperfused myocardial injury.
 The current study determined the effectiveness of nicardipine, a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, in preserving reperfused myocardium in a cat model of temporary coronary occlusion and ascertained if replenishment of myocardial phosphate stores during reperfusion as defined by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was indicative of salvage.
 Twenty open chest, anesthetized cats were studied with use of a snare ligature around the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery, with a coil sutured to the epicardial surface overlying the distribution of the artery.
 Peak areas of phosphocreatine, inorganic phosphate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) NMR signals were measured during 1 h of occlusion followed by 1.5 h of reperfusion.
 Infarct size and jeopardy area were determined in vitro by simultaneous infusion of phthalocyanine blue dye and triphenyltetrazolium chloride into the aorta and the left anterior descending coronary artery, respectively, after 5 h of myocardial reperfusion.
 Nicardipine-treated and control groups had similar jeopardy area values (41.2 +/- 1.6% versus 47.4 +/- 3.1% of the left ventricle), but infarct area was significantly reduced in the nicardipine-treated group (3.2 +/- 1.1% versus 24.9 +/- 7.5% of jeopardy area, p less than 0.01).
 High energy phosphate compounds remained markedly altered during reperfusion in both groups.
 No significant improvement in phosphocreatine or inorganic phosphate recovery was observed in animals pretreated with nicardipine despite an 87% reduction in infarct size.
 Myocardial ATP was greater during reperfusion in the nicardipine-treated compared with the control group (average over initial 90 min of reperfusion 58 +/- 6% versus 46 +/- 3% of baseline values, p less than 0.05), suggesting improved recovery of ATP.
 However, the measured levels of high energy phosphate compounds during reperfusion and their ratios did not correlate with infarct size and thus were not predictive of myocardial salvage.

 To determine if patients who had lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion and a pleural biopsy without any specific findings could be histopathologically differentiated between those with tuberculous and nontuberculous pleuritis, we histologically re-evaluated the pleural biopsies of all patients whose pleural effusion was predominant with lymphocytes and contained no malignant cells.
 A total of 40 patients with a nonspecific histologic findings of pleural biopsy specimen were categorized based on their ultimate diagnosis as having tuberculous (n = 15), carcinomatous (n = 10) or nontuberculous, benign pleuritis (n = 15).
 The pleural biopsy specimen of patients with nontuberculous, benign pleuritis frequently showed a band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate (10 out of 15 patients), while the same finding was infrequent in those with tuberculous pleuritis (0 out of 15, p = 0.0001) and pleuritis associated with carcinoma (three out of 10, p = 0.082).
 Based on these results, the presence of band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate in pleural biopsy specimens of patients with lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion suggests that the pleuritis is nontuberculous in its nature.

"Southern blood club symposium: an update on selected aspects of hemochromatosis.
 Genetic epidemiology studies have indicated that hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) occurs in caucasians with a frequency of 3 to 13 per thousand.
 Clinical recognition however occurs far less frequently.
 The disparity is best resolved by defining HH as homozygosity for the HLA-linked hemochromatosis allele, regardless of the total body iron burden.
 Variability of clinical expression is explained in part by physiologic iron loss in women but variability in males may be due to environmental factors, gene-gene interactions or polymorphisms in mutated hemochromatosis alleles.
 Although clinical variability is great, the laboratory phenotype of HH is fairly constant and is marked by elevation of the transferrin saturation.
 The elevated transferrin saturation occurs early in life, before organ iron loading occurs and can be used as a screening tool to detect HH before organ damage occurs.
 Cloning and characterizing the HH gene, which is located within 1 centimorgan of the HLA-A locus should resolve some of the issues concerning clinical variability.

 This study was aimed at defining the natural history of renal failure in obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma, which is an important health problem in northeastern Thailand.
 Sixty-four patients among a total of 130 patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to cholangiocarcinoma who developed acute renal failure were studied retrospectively.
 Analysis was made with respect to clinical features, laboratory findings, and outcome.
 The development of renal failure before surgery was observed in all patients.

 The mean duration of renal failure was 2 weeks.
 All patients underwent surgery for the relief of jaundice.
 Seventy-seven percent of the patients survived and had recovery of renal function after the relief of jaundice.
 Twenty-three percent of the patients died of infection.
 Clinical data highlight the higher serum bilirubin levels and the frequent occurrence of hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypotension in renal failure.
 Their possible roles in contributing to the development of renal failure are discussed.

"Calcium and blood pressure. An epidemiologic perspective.
 We reviewed the research literature on the epidemiologic relationship between blood pressure levels and calcium, with an emphasis on dietary intake.
 A conceptual framework for causal inference is summarized; then the designs and results of observational and intervention studies are presented.
 Of 25 reports of observational studies relating intake of calcium or calcium-rich foods to blood pressure, the majority found some evidence of an inverse association.
 However, many analyses did not support this relationship, and only two studies have confirmed the inverse association with a prospective design.
 Nineteen randomized controlled clinical trials of calcium supplementation have been reported, excluding those exclusively in pregnant women.
 Eleven of these showed no significant effects on blood pressure; in two trials, both systolic and diastolic pressure were significantly reduced; and in the remainder results were equivocal.
 Pooled analyses yielded estimates of a small (1.8 mm Hg), significant reduction in systolic blood pressure, but no effect on diastolic pressure.
 Epidemiologic relationships with serum and urinary calcium, and the possible mechanisms of these effects, are also discussed.
 We conclude that the evidence from studies in humans is suggestive, but not conclusive, regarding a role for calcium in hypertension.

 The MCAD was activated 30-40 min after coronary artery occlusion and synchronized with the R-wave.
 As illustrated by a representative sample of the data obtained from one of several trials, the preliminary experimental results demonstrated that the MCAD worked effectively to fulfill the primary functions of a counterpulsation assist device, i.e., augmentation of coronary perfusion and reduction in the vascular impedance to ventricular ejection.

"The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique.
 The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique (EDAT) uses noninvasive equipment to record, simultaneously, ""feeding respiratory patterns,"" the time drink entered the mouth, and associated swallow sounds during feeding.
 The easily portable equipment enabled patients' swallowing ability to be tested, at the bedside if necessary, using a small amount of fruit-flavored drink.
 The results appear in chart form.
 EDAT findings from groups of normal subjects aged 2-90 years were compared with those from patients with dysphagia of neurologic origin and normal subjects under experimental feeding conditions.
 The results revealed maturation of the feeding respiratory pattern in the teenage years and remarkable consistency thereafter.
 Differences in the recordings between the normal and abnormal subjects were sufficiently marked to allow the findings to be used in the diagnosis of other patients with dysphagia of doubtful neurologic cause.
 Interpretation of the charts and recorded timings of the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing permitted a more accurate identification of sensory nerve, motor nerve, and functional involvement causing dysphagia of neurologic origin and may be used as a guide to the origin of the sensory deficit.

"Comparison of medical and surgical therapy for uncomplicated descending aortic dissection.
 To guide the choice of medical versus surgical therapy for patients with descending (type B) aortic dissection (tear in the descending aorta without involvement of the ascending aorta), multivariate survival analysis was applied to 136 patients admitted to two medical centers between 1975 and 1988 with acute (n = 89) or chronic (n = 47) descending dissection: group 1, all 136 patients; group 2, 106 patients without rupture, pulse loss, or visceral organ compromise; and group 3, 56 patients from group 2 without major cardiac or renal disease (23 surgical and 33 medical).
 Group 3 medical and surgical subgroups were well matched for baseline characteristics and were potential candidates for either mode of therapy.
 By Cox model analysis, significant predictors of mortality were pleural rupture, other dissection complications, increasing age, and cardiac disease (all p less than 0.01).
 Surgical versus medical therapy was not an independent determinant of survival in any of the three groups for acute or chronic dissection.
 Survival probabilities for all group 3 patients at 1, 5, and 10 years were 0.94, 0.87, and 0.32 (medical) and 0.90, 0.80, and 0.50 (surgical).
 Despite the limitations of this retrospective study (including the possibility of undefined treatment selection biases), these data suggest that medical or early surgical therapy is associated with equivalent outcome in selected patients with uncomplicated acute or chronic descending aortic dissection.

"N-ras 61 oncogene mutations in Hurthle cell tumors.
 Mutations of ras oncogenes are believed to play an important role in the initiation or progression of human tumors.
 In thyroid tumors the incidence of ras activation by specific point mutations has been reported to range from 33% in follicular adenomas up to 60% in anaplastic carcinomas.
 Because of our long-standing interest in Hurthle cell tumors, we began a study of 70 such cases to determine the incidence of ras mutations and their clinical correlates.
 Analysis of N-ras sequences at condon position 61, with the polymerase chain reaction method and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, showed point mutations of the normal codon CAA* in eight tumor samples.
 One was a mutation from CAA to AAA, one from CAA to CTA,* and six from CAA to CGA.
 These mutations would result in amino acid substitutions of lysine, leucine, or arginine for the normal glutamine at position 61 in the N-ras protein.
 Identical ras mutations in two tumors and some of their surrounding thyroid tissue may indicate that activating ras point mutations are an early event in carcinogenesis.
 The incidence of mutations was 1 of 24 (4%) of the histologically benign tumors, 5 of 34 (15%) of the intermediate tumors (with vascular or capsular permeation), and 2 of 12 (17%) in the malignant group.
 Four of these eight patients died of metastatic thyroid disease and four are alive without evidence of recurrence.

"An efficient method for removing bilirubin.
 Bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin, making hemoperfusion an ineffective treatment for hyperbilirubinemia.
 By adding a safe unbinding agent to the blood (solutizer), which itself is adsorbed, hemoperfusion can become efficient and practical.
 Canines were made hyperbilirubinemic with an intravenous infusion of a 5 mg/ml solution (with Na2CO3) for 1 hour.
 Peak concentrations of 14-22 mg/dl were reached in adult dogs (25-35 kg).
 Hemoperfusion was then initiated with or without (control) the solutizer (sodium benzoate).
 The bilirubin unbinding effect of sodium benzoate was rapid and effective.
 Because of the simultaneous adsorption of sodium benzoate, a small activated carbon section that was presaturated with the solutizer was located proximal to the main hemoperfusion column, in addition to continuous infusion to reach 20 mM in the blood.
 Comparison of the normalized bilirubin concentration for benzoate augmented hemoperfusion with the average for control dogs, shows that benzoate results in a threefold decrease in the normalized bilirubin concentration after 1.5 hr of hemoperfusion.
 Sodium benzoate may also have the advantage of protecting platelets during hemoperfusion.

"Lymphoproliferative disorders associated with carbamazepine.
 Carbamazepine-induced lymphoproliferative disorders are relatively rare.
 A 32-year-old woman developed cervical lymphadenopathy while taking carbamazepine.
 Histologic evaluation of the lymph node biopsy specimen demonstrated near-total effacement of the nodal architecture by a population of pleomorphic immunoblasts.
 The predominant cell population expressed CD3, CD2, CD5, and CD4, while results of testing for CD8 were negative.
 On the basis of the morphologic and immunohistologic features, a diagnosis of high-grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, T-cell immunoblastic type, was made.
 Despite the fact that aggressive behavior is usually associated with immunoblastic lymphomas, the patient has done well for 33 months after cessation of carbamazepine in the absence of chemotherapeutic treatment.
 The clinical features of this patient's illness, therefore, suggest that it is best regarded as a so-called pseudolymphoma.

"Quality control practices in centralized tumor registries in North America.
 A survey of quality control practices was mailed to 73 central registries in the U.S.
 and Canada.
 The response rate was 88%, with respondents representing a wide range of registry characteristics and reporting strategies.
 While registries expressed different priorities in data use, 80% of respondents felt quality control data were important in the identification of problems.
 The most common method of quality control was acceptance sampling (used by 97% of respondents), and took the form of visual review, recoding and edit checking.
 Computer-based edit checks were almost universally used (95%).
 Process control methods of any sort were used by only 22% of respondents with less than 4% of registries reporting formal quantitative criteria.
 Sixty-one percent of respondents reported conducting one or more designed studies (e.g.
 reabstracting or casefinding studies) but only 20% of those made the results public.
 Greater emphasis should be placed on development of quantitative process controls, experimental design of quality control studies, and formal analyses and reporting of study results.

"Decrease in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose after high-dose methotrexate in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia.
 We measured changes in the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRGlu) using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography for the assessment of neurotoxicity in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia treated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) therapy.
 We studied 8 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia (mean age: 9.6 years) treated with HD-MTX (200 mg/kg or 2,000 mg/M2) therapy.
 CMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy was most reduced (40%) in the patient who had central nervous system leukemia and was treated with the largest total doses of both intrathecal MTX (IT-MTX) and HD-MTX.
 CMRGlu in the whole brain after HD-MTX therapy was reduced by an average of 21% (P less than 0.05).
 The reductions of CMRGlu in 8 patients were correlated with total doses of both IT-MTX (r = 0.717; P less than 0.05) and systemic HD-MTX (r = 0.784; P less than 0.05).
 CMRGlu of the cerebral cortex, especially the frontal and occipital cortex, was reduced more noticeably than that of the basal ganglia and white matter.
 We suggest that the measurement of changes in rCMRGlu after HD-MTX therapy is useful for detecting accumulated MTX neurotoxicity.

"Brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene fistulas for hemodialysis.
 A retrospective analysis was made of 16 patients who had received a brachial-jugular polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft for hemodialysis.
 In four patients, the procedure was used to treat malfunctioning brachio-axillary fistulas due to long venous stenosis in the axillary vein.
 In 12 other patients, the operation was chosen in cases of exhaustion of the veins in the upper extremity because of previous multiple failed fistulas.
 Two patients died with a functioning fistula 7 and 10 months after placement of the graft of causes unrelated to the vascular access.
 The other 14 patients retained functioning fistulas between 8 and 26 months after construction of the shunt.
 Three patients needed graft thrombectomy to treat occlusive episodes.
 No venous stenosis was found in a postoperative fistulography made in those patients.
 One patient needed substitution of a graft segment due to stenosis of the prosthesis crossing over the clavicle.
 We believe that the brachial-jugular graft is a procedure that can be considered as vascular access for hemodialysis in cases where the use of veins in the upper extremity and the axilla is not possible.

"Antitumor activity of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin in advanced breast cancer: phase II study.
 Previous studies in animals have demonstrated liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin (LED) has substantially less cardiac toxicity than free doxorubicin but retains antitumor activity.
 In a phase I clinical study of LED, the maximum tolerated dose was 90 mg/m2 and dose-limiting toxicity was considered to have been reached when granulocytopenia was produced.
 We used LED to treat 20 patients with advanced, measurable breast cancer.
 LED was given at doses of 60-75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks as an intravenous infusion.
 Regression of disease was objectively measured in nine patients; in five of these patients, complete regression of the index lesion occurred.
 The mean duration of the responses was 7 months.
 Hematologic toxicity consisted of grade 1-2 leukopenia in some patients.
 Gastrointestinal toxicity and mucositis were generally mild and tolerable.
 Alopecia occurred in all patients and usually was complete.
 Twelve patients received cumulative doses of LED of greater than 400 mg/m2 and were evaluated with radionuclide ventriculograms.
 In eight patients, the cumulative dose was greater than 500 mg/m2, and five had endomyocardial biopsies.
 Four of these biopsy results were Billingham grade 0, while one (cumulative LED dose, 750 mg/m2) showed grade 1 changes with mild myofibrillar loss and dilatation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum involving less than 5% of cardiac myocytes.
 Two patients had decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction.
 One of these patients had received a total dose of LED of 630 mg/m2 and had a decline of 13% in left ventricular ejection fraction, but had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure and had a Billingham grade 0 endomyocardial biopsy.

"The changing clinical spectrum of thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).
 Between 1970 and 1987, 112 patients were diagnosed as having thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO).
 The age was 42 +/- 11 years (mean +/- SD; range, 20-75 years); 23% were women, and 7% were more than 60 years old when they were first diagnosed.
 Ischemic ulcerations were present in 85 (76%) patients: 24 (28%) patients with upper-extremity, 39 (46%) patients with lower-extremity, and 22 (26%) patients with both upper- and lower-extremity lesions.
 Ninety-one (81%) patients had rest pain, 49 (44%) patients had Raynaud's phenomenon, and 43 (38%) patients had superficial thrombophlebitis.
 We were able to follow up 89 of the 112 (79%) patients for 1-460 months (mean follow-up time, 91.6 +/- 84 months).
 Sixty-five (73%) patients had no amputations, while 24 (27%) had one or more of the following amputations: finger, six (15%) patients; toe, 13 (33%) patients; transmetatarsal, four (10%) patients; below knee, 14 (36%) patients; and above knee, two (5%) patients.

 The spectrum of patients with TAO is changing in that the male-to-female ratio is decreasing (3:1), more older patients are being diagnosed, and upper-extremity involvement is commonly present.
 In the 48% of patients who stopped smoking, amputations and continued disease activity were uncommon.

"Insulin-like growth factor I expression by tumors of neuroectodermal origin with the t(11;22) chromosomal translocation. A potential autocrine growth factor.
 Expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA by some tumor cell lines of neuroectodermal origin has been described.
 To further explore the significance of IGF-I mRNA expression in these tumors, a more extensive analysis was performed.
 Most (9 of 10) neuroectodermal tumor cell lines with a t(11;22) translocation (primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], Ewing's sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I mRNA, whereas 0 of 15 cell lines without the translocation (PNET, neuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I.
 Furthermore, inasmuch as all neuroblastoma (12 of 12) cell lines examined expressed IGF-II RNA, the pattern of IGF expression could distinguish between these closely related tumors.
 CHP-100, a PNET cell line with the t(11;22) translocation, was shown to secrete both IGF-I protein and an IGF binding protein, IGFBP-2.
 This cell line also expressed the type I IGF receptor mRNA, and blockade of this receptor by a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR3) inhibited serum-free growth.
 These data demonstrate that IGF-I expression is a property of neuroectodermal tumors with a t(11;22) translocation and that interruption of an IGF-I autocrine loop inhibits the growth of these tumor cells.

"Gut blood flow velocities in the newborn: effects of patent ductus arteriosus and parenteral indomethacin 
 The effects on gut blood flow velocities of parenteral indomethacin (0.2 mg/kg) given either quickly as a bolus or slowly as an infusion were compared in consecutive studies of two groups of infants with symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus.
 In the presence of patent ductus arteriosus the range of velocities in the superior mesenteric artery before indomethacin was given was characterised by pronounced abnormalities including absent--or in some cases even retrograde--diastolic flow.
 In eight subjects the first rapidly given bolus dose of indomethacin (duration 20 seconds or less) caused a pronounced and sustained fall in the velocity of the superior mesenteric artery blood flow (mean peak systolic velocity (cm/second): before 74; after 38; median time to maximum fall 7.4 minutes; median time to recovery 50 minutes).
 A further 10 subjects received their first dose of indomethacin by slow infusion (duration 30-35 min) and the percentage fall in peak systolic velocity was both substantially less (22% compared with 47%) and later (median time to maximum fall 37.3 minutes) than after rapid infusion.
 Qualitatively similar but smaller changes were seen in the coeliac axis.
 Return of antegrade end diastolic flow in the superior mesenteric artery within one hour of the first dose of indomethacin was a good predictor of subsequent closure of the ductus.
 These data suggest that there is a profound disturbance in mid gut perfusion in infants with patent ductus, which is exacerbated by indomethacin given rapidly by intravenous bolus.
 They may also provide a rational explanation for the well recognised association between necrotising enterocolitis and both patent ductus arteriosus and indomethacin administration.

 We studied the rate of revision in 84 consecutive total hip replacements performed for failed osteosynthesis of femoral neck fractures and compared it with that for primary arthroplasty for osteoarthritis.
 The age and sex adjusted risk of prosthetic failure was 2.5 times higher after failure of fixation, but all the excess risk was in patients over 70 years of age.
 There were radiographic signs of loosening of the femoral component at five to 12 years after secondary arthroplasty in six of 33 survivors.
 In general, the results of secondary replacement were no worse than those obtained after primary arthroplasty for femoral neck fracture.

"Resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest by ambulance staff with extended training in West Yorkshire 
 OBJECTIVE--To investigate the results of resuscitation of patients with cardiac arrest by ambulance staff with extended training in West Yorkshire.
 DESIGN--Study of all such attempts at resuscitation over 32 months, based on the standard report form for each call made by the ambulance staff and the electrocardiogram that showed the initial rhythm in each patient.
 SETTING--Area covered by West Yorkshire ambulance service.
 SUBJECTS--1196 Patients with cardiac arrests attended by 29 ambulance staff with extended training.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Result of resuscitation.
 RESULTS--The initial rhythm was asystole or electromechanical dissociation in 740 patients and ventricular fibrillation in 456 patients; overall 65 patients survived to be discharged from hospital.
 Sixty four of the 456 patients in whom ventricular fibrillation was the initial rhythm recorded, and 46 in whom ventricular fibrillation persisted after the ambulance staff arrived, survived.
 Only one of the 740 patients who initially had asystole or electromechanical dissociation survived.
 Factors associated with a greater chance of ventricular fibrillation occurring were: age less than 71, the arrest being witnessed by a bystander, resuscitation by a bystander, the arrest occurring in a public place, and a response time by the ambulance staff of less than six minutes.
 For patients found in ventricular fibrillation a shorter response time was associated with improved survival but resuscitation by a bystander was not.
 Additional skills learnt during extended training were used for 51 of the 65 patients who survived.
 CONCLUSIONS--Ambulance staff with extended training can save the lives of patients with cardiac arrest due to fibrillation, though asystole and electromechanical dissociation have a poor prognosis and should perhaps receive little attention during extended training.

"Change in hexose distribution volume and fractional utilization of [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose in brain during acute hypoglycemia in humans.
 We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the effects of mild hypoglycemia on cerebral glucose uptake and metabolism.
 Nine healthy men were studied under basal saline-infusion conditions, and during euglycemic and hypoglycemic clamp studies.
 Insulin was infused at the same rate (1 mU.kg-1.min-1) in both clamp studies.
 In euglycemic clamp studies, glucose was infused at a rate sufficient to maintain the basal plasma glucose concentration, whereas in hypoglycemic clamp studies, the glucose infusion rate was reduced to maintain the plasma glucose at 3.1 mM.
 Each study lasted 3 h and included a 30-min baseline period and a subsequent 150-min period in which insulin or glucose was administered.
 Blood samples for measurement of insulin, glucose, cortisol, growth hormone, and glucagon were obtained at 20- to 30-min intervals.
 A bolus injection of 5-10 mCi [18F]-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (2-DFG) was administered 120 min after initiation of the study, and plasma radioactivity and dynamic PET scans were obtained at frequent intervals for the remaining 40-60 min of the study.
 Cerebral regions of interest were defined, and concentrations of radioactivity were calculated and used in the three-compartment model of 2-DFG distribution described by Sokoloff.
 Glucose levels were similar during saline-infusion (4.9 +/- 0.1 mM) and euglycemic clamp (4.8 +/- 0.1 mM) studies, whereas the desired degree of mild hypoglycemia was achieved during the hypoglycemic clamp study (3.1 +/- 0.1 mM, P less than 0.05).

"Changes in circulating norepinephrine with hemofiltration in advanced congestive heart failure.
 In congestive heart failure (CHF), hemofiltration is associated with an obvious decrease in circulating norepinephrine.
 This method was used for investigating the mechanisms whereby plasma norepinephrine is increased in chronic CHF.
 In 23 cases of advanced CHF, hemofiltration (2,983 +/- 1,228 ml) lowered plasma norepinephrine by 515 +/- 444 pg/ml.
 This effect was prompt, persisted or became greater in the next 24 hours.
 It was not associated with significant changes in cardiac output, aortic pressure or systemic vascular resistance.
 It did not appear to depend on variations in parameters related to the sympathetic activity, such as plasma renin, right atrial, wedge pulmonary artery and renal perfusion pressures, and was independent of duration and amount of hemofiltration.
 These observations did not support the concept that the norepinephrine decrease was the main consequence of a neural sympathetic inhibition.
 Hemofiltration increased diuresis by 606 +/- 415 ml; changes were prompt and correlated inversely (r = -0.7; p less than 0.01) with those in plasma norepinephrine.
 The same unknown mechanism of the increased urinary output might potentiate the norepinephrine removal from the blood by the kidney, or hemofiltration and the augmented diuresis might result in a regression of congestion of lungs and kidneys, leading to an improved extraction of norepinephrine.
 In CHF, a relation may exist between fluid retention and norepinephrine and in advanced stages, circulating norepinephrine, although strikingly increased, is devoid of important cardiovascular effects.
 At these stages, plasma norepinephrine is probably unreliable as an index of the sympathetic neural activity.

"WHO Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes. WHO Diamond Project Group.
 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is one of the most important chronic diseases of children worldwide.
 IDDM leads to an 8- to 10-fold excess risk of mortality in developed countries, whereas in developing countries, most cases die within a few years.
 A 60-fold international gradient in IDDM incidence has been reported, and epidemic periods have been identified.
 A new World Health Organization program, Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes (Diabetes Mondiale or DIAMOND), has been developed to investigate and characterize global incidence, mortality, and health care.
 Over 10 yr (1990-1999), this study will collect population-based data concerning IDDM in greater than 90 centers in 50 countries worldwide.
 The goals of DIAMOND are to collect standard information on incidence, risk factors, and mortality associated with IDDM; evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of health care and the economics of diabetes; and establish national and international training programs in diabetes epidemiology.
 It is hoped that the DIAMOND project will be instrumental for the prevention of this serious disease and its sequelae.

"Studies on requirements for trackpoints in CellSoft automated semen analysis.
 The CellSoft (CRYO Resources, Ltd., New York, NY) system for computer-assisted sperm analysis was evaluated as to the appropriate settings for trackpoints.
 Fifty-eight human spermatozoa exhibiting complex swimming modes were chosen for analysis at room temperature.
 The accumulated measures for curvilinear velocity, linearity, mean and maximum amplitude of lateral head displacement, and beat cross frequency were determined over a range of trackpoints from 2 to 37.
 Stable measures (within the 95% confidence interval at 37 frames) were observed at 4 frames for curvilinear velocity and at 20 frames for linearity.
 The corresponding figure for mean amplitude of lateral head displacement and beat cross frequency was 8 frames.

 Thus, 20 consecutive frames to analyze will suffice.

"Cytotoxic and immunologic effects of methotrexate in psoriasis.
 Based on recent experience that Cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressive drug, produces marked improvement in psoriasis, possible immunomodulatory activities of methotrexate (MTX) have been reviewed to look for alternate mechanisms of MTX action in psoriasis.
 It is generally considered that the therapeutic results of MTX in psoriasis are related to a direct effect on epidermal cell hyperplasia through inhibition of DNA synthesis.
 Several studies in the literature now suggest possible effects of MTX on the immune system of psoriatics as well as in animal models that may have some pathogenic similarities to psoriasis.
 In psoriatics receiving MTX, neutrophil chemotaxis is suppressed, resulting in a possible alteration in the potential pathologic activity of neutrophils commonly found in lesional skin.
 MTX does improve both psoriatic and rheumatoid arthritis.
 Animal studies of the latter using adjuvant arthritis and graft vs host disease (GVHD) have indicated several possible mechanisms for MTX that affect these processes.
 In GVHD, MTX selectively destroys cycling CD8+ cells, and in adjuvant arthritis the activation of macrophages is prevented by inhibition of T-cell function.
 While MTX generally has not been clinically utilized as an immunomodulatory drug for immunologically related diseases, it may, nonetheless, have selective actions that could be specific for some diseases.
 MTX and Cyclosporin A could work mechanistically in similar ways but at different steps in the activation of T cells and macrophages.
 It may be that the major direct effect of MTX on epidermal cell proliferation is complemented or even mediated by subtle immunoregulatory effects on the melange of cells in the affected skin and the systemic immune response.

"Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy.
 Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension.
 While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS.
 Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events.
 Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics.
 Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant.
 Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety.
 Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature.
 Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.

"Arterial abnormalities of the hand in athletes.
 Vascular lesions of the hand may be seen in athletes exposed to repetitive blunt trauma.
 Thirteen athletes seen from 1983 to 1988 experienced symptoms related to hand ischemia.
 Nine were professional baseball catchers.
 The majority of patients complained of chronic symptoms, including cold hypersensitivity (four patients), finger numbness (one), finger coolness (three), and finger blanching (three).
 Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain.
 Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing.
 Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors.
 Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain.
 All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively.
 Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding.
 The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran.
 All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms.

"Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in the elderly. I. Pathologic features at presentation.
 The pathologic findings of 118 patients aged 70 years or older with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) are reported.
 These patients formed 27.2% of 433 consecutive cases of NHL seen in a single institution over a 5-year period.
 Thirty-one of 433 NHL cases were histologically not classified, whereas the remaining 402 could be classified according to the International Working Formulation (WF) of NHL for clinical usage.
 Immunophenotypic analyses were carried out in 112 NHL cases; of this group 28 were NHL in elderly patients.
 Of the 95 elderly NHL that could be classified in the histologic categories of the WF 28 cases were in the low-grade, 41 in the intermediate-grade, and 26 in the high-grade categories.
 Eighty-one cases had diffuse histologic types and 14 had follicular/nodular histologic types.
 Thirty-five cases were of the G (diffuse large cell) + H (large cell, immunoblastic) categories.
 No significant differences in the prevalence of the different subtypes were observed among patients younger or older than 70 years.
 Immunohistologically, most NHL cases in the elderly expressed B-cell phenotype.
 Sixty-two NHL in the elderly were extranodal at presentation.
 The results of this study indicate that elderly patients form a relevant proportion of patients developing NHL and thereby present a very difficult management problem.
 The pathologic features of NHL in the elderly does not differ significantly from those of their younger counterparts, although an increase in diffuse versus follicular histologic patterns, and in extranodal versus nodal disease was observed with advancing age.

"Left ventricular mass regression after aortic valve replacement measured by ultrafast computed tomography.
 Left ventricular mass and function were measured using ultrafast computed tomography, and were correlated with clinical status in 17 patients with aortic stenosis and/or insufficiency undergoing aortic valve replacement or balloon valvuloplasty.
 Wall mass was 159 +/- 38 gm/m2 initially, decreased 25% to 116 +/- 29 gm/m2 at 4 month (p less than 0.001), and decreased a total of 34% to 105 +/- 33 gm/m2 at 8 months after valve repair.
 By 8 months not only was the mean wall mass within the normal range, but only three patients retained abnormal hypertrophy.
 Ejection fraction increased 8% (p = 0.06).
 Clinical function improved in all patients, with only three patients remaining outside of New York Heart Association functional class 1 at 8 months.
 Regression of ventricular mass into the normal range correlated with attainment of class 1 functional status (p less than 0.02), despite a lack of increase of ejection fraction.
 The single patient followed for 8 months after valvuloplasty had minor wall mass regression and minor clinical improvement.

"Colorectal cancer: have we identified an effective screening strategy?
 Three currently used screening methods are aimed at detecting colorectal cancer when it is asymptomatic and curable, and at detecting polyps so that they can be removed before they can progress to cancer.
 Digital rectal examinations are relatively cheap and easy but can detect only a small fraction of large-bowel cancers.
 Sigmoidoscopy is more sensitive, but its low acceptability to patients has been only partially mitigated by the introduction of the 35-cm flexible instrument.
 Fecal occult blood testing has limited sensitivity because blood from cancers and polyps is neither continuously shed nor uniformly distributed in feces; specificity and positive predictive value are also low because of other sources of blood in the stool.
 Prudent judgment suggests that all of these screening tests may prevent death from colorectal cancer in some patients.
 However, none has been proven effective in general use by well-controlled studies.
 Case-control studies can provide timely and valuable new evidence in this regard; the authors' investigations in progress are described.
 The current lack of strong evidence in support of these screening tests should not be interpreted as evidence against their use.

"Laser photodynamic therapy for papilloma viral lesions.
 Photodynamic therapy was tested for its therapeutic efficacy in eradicating rabbit papilloma warts.
 The wild-type viral warts suspension was used to induce treatable papilloma warts in the cutaneous tissue of Dutch Belted rabbits.
 The photosensitizing agents used intravenously were Photofrin II at 10 mg/kg of body weight and Chlorin e6 monoethylene diamine monohydrochloric acid (Chlorin e6 med HCl) at 1 mg/kg of body weight.
 The lasers used were an argon-dye laser at 628 and 655 nm and a gold vapor laser at 628 nm.
 The irradiances of 25 to 180 mW/cm2 were applied topically with an end-on lens optical fiber with total radiant doses of 7.5 to 54 J/cm2.
 Photofrin II and the argon-dye laser at the highest light dosage (54 J/cm2) and Chlorin e6 monoethylene diamine monohydrochloride administered 2 hours before argon-dye laser irradiation at 655 nm at the highest light dosage (54 J/cm2) produced wart regression.
 Total wart regression without recurrence was achieved with Photofrin II and the gold vapor laser at all light dosages.
 The difference observed between the argon-dye laser and the gold vapor laser might be explained by the pulsed nature of the gold vapor laser, with its high-peak powers, some 5000 x the average measured light dose.
 In this model, the smaller, less cornified lesions were more effectively treated with photodynamic therapy.

"Platysma myocutaneous flap for repair of hypopharyngeal strictures.
 Hypopharyngeal strictures, either isolated or in conjunction with laryngeal and esophageal strictures, can occur following lye ingestion.
 Extensive stricture formation requires reconstruction to create a functional funnel system that empties below the cricoid.
 Esophageal replacement is not a substitute for adequate hypopharyngeal reconstruction.
 The pectoralis major muscle is often inadequate, because it yields too much bulk and often leads to continued aspiration.

"Effects of spermatic vascular division for correction of the high undescended testis on testicular function.
 Orchiopexy with division of the spermatic artery and veins is a commonly used technique for correcting the high undescended testis, although the longterm results have not been clearly defined.
 The left spermatic artery and veins of 22 adult Wistar albino rats were divided while preserving the vessels associated with the vas and cremaster muscle (DT).
 A sham operation was performed on the left testicle of six additional rats (ST).
 At 3 weeks postoperatively, both testes from all rats were removed.
 All testes were viable and bled when incised, although bleeding was considerably reduced in testes with DT.
 Mean testicular weights after DT were 1,061 +/- 423 mg compared with 1,634 +/- 125 mg for ST rats (p less than 0.02) and 1,508 +/- 119 mg for contralateral testes.
 The mean tubular diameter after DT was 220 +/- 37 mu compared with 303.1 +/- 10.7 mu for ST testes (p less than 0.02).
 The testicular biopsy score based upon the morphology of the spermatic tubules was 4.46 +/- 3.32 for DT testes and 8.65 +/- 0.23 for ST testes (p less than 0.02) compared with 8.38 +/- 0.18 for contralateral testes and an absolute normal value of 10.
 No morphologic abnormalities were observed in the contralateral unoperated testes from any of the rats.
 The contralateral testes in 12 additional rats were removed before DT.
 The mean testosterone values in these rats with one testicle was 1.43 +/- 0.75 ng/mL.
 Three weeks after DT, testosterone values were 0.19 +/- 0.31 ng/mL (p less than 0.01).
 It is concluded that division of the main spermatic artery and vein in rats produces testicular atrophy with spermatogenic arrest and interstitial cell dysfunction.
 Although collateral blood flow to the testis may be demonstrated, tissue perfusion is inadequate for normal spermatogenesis and endocrine function.

"Influence of prosthetic design on durability of the Liotta porcine valve in the mitral position.
 From March 1979 to December 1984, the Liotta low-profile porcine bioprosthesis was employed for mitral valve replacement in 71 patients to avoid potential left ventricle-prosthesis mismatch occasionally observed with the standard, high-profile, Hancock porcine xenograft.
 Follow-up of 61 operative survivors showed at 10 years an actuarial survival of 67% +/- 7%, freedom from thromboemboli of 96% +/- 2%, freedom from structural deterioration of 63% +/- 11% and freedom from all Liotta bioprosthesis-related complications of 53% +/- 10%.
 Complications related to excessive protrusion of the stent into the left ventricular cavity were eliminated with the Liotta bioprosthesis; the peculiar stent configuration, however, was responsible for an increased rate of structural deterioration requiring reoperation in 10 patients (2.8% +/- 0.9%/patient-year) at a mean interval of 76 +/- 18 months after mitral valve replacement (range, 45 to 106 months).
 Common findings in all explants were cusp prolapse, cusp tears, and commissural rupture related to various degrees of tissue calcification, constantly leading to severe prosthetic incompetence.
 As also shown experimentally, such structural changes have been attributed to increased systolic stresses on the closed cusps, favored by excessive reduction of the stent height.
 Our experience shows that the Liotta bioprosthesis used for mitral valve replacement does not provide any clear-cut advantage over standard porcine bioprostheses and that its long-term durability appears affected by the unique prosthetic design.

"Prostacyclin but not phentolamine increases oxygen consumption and skin microvascular blood flow in patients with sepsis and respiratory failure.
 Inadequate tissue oxygenation may occur in critically ill patients with sepsis despite an apparently adequate O2 transport (QO2), and this may contribute to the development of an O2 debt and also to multiple organ failure.
 It has been shown that increasing QO2 by infusing a vasodilator may reveal this O2 debt in septic patients.
 To investigate whether the site of action of vasodilators may be of importance in unmasking such an O2 debt, we administered prostacyclin, a prostaglandin with a preferential effect on the microcirculation, and phentolamine, an arteriolar vasodilator, in 11 patients studied during the first 48 hours after the onset of sepsis, and compared their effect on whole body oxygen consumption (VO2) and skin microvascular blood flow.
 The results demonstrated that increasing QO2 by prostacyclin but not by phentolamine significantly increases VO2 in critically ill patients with sepsis.
 The site of action of vasodilators may therefore play an important role in their ability to unmask an O2 debt.

"Factors determining success and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation.
 Factors thought to affect the success of and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation were studied in 80 (49 male, 31 female) patients aged 21-88 (mean 61.5 years).
 Transthoracic impedance was measured in advance of the countershock using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through self-adhesive ECG/defibrillator pads (diameters 8-12 cm) applied to the chest in the antero-posterior (AP) position in 57 patients and the anteroapical (AA) position in 23 patients.
 Mean transthoracic impedance for all patients was 69.3 +/- 16 (SD) ohms (range 39-131 ohms), but transthoracic impedance was significantly greater in the AA than the AP position (75.4 +/- 13 vs.
 66.7 +/- 16 ohms, p = 0.02).
 Initial energy was 50 J (delivered) and was gradually increased to a maximum of 360 J if required.
 Cardioversion was successful in 73 of 80 (91.2 per cent), and low energy shocks (less than or equal to 200 J) were successful in 45 of 80 (56.2 per cent) patients.
 Using single factor analysis, sex, left atrial enlargement, electrode pad positions, aetiology of atrial fibrillation, presence of left ventricular failure, and prior treatment with verapamil or beta-adrenergic blockers were not significant determinants of cardioversion success or success of low energy shocks but prior treatment with digoxin was, both for cardioversion success and success at low energies.
 In patients with transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 70 ohms, low energy shocks were more often successful (33 or 50, 66 per cent) than in patients with transthoracic impedance greater than 70 ohms (12 of 30, 40 per cent), p = 0.04.
 Using univariate analysis, cardioversion success with low energy shocks was not only significantly associated with prior treatment with digoxin but also with the duration of atrial fibrillation (24 hours to one month and one month to three years) and for shocks of less than or equal to 100 J, with prior treatment with amiodarone.
 Multifactorial linear regression analysis selected, in rank order, only duration of atrial fibrillation of 24 hours to less than one month and one month to three years as significant predictors of both cardioversion success irrespective of shock strength, and success of low energy shocks.

"Local anesthesia for neonatal circumcisions: are family practice residents likely to use it?
 Dorsal penile nerve block with lidocaine (DPNB) is a local anesthetic technique for neonatal circumcision which is both effective and consistent with ethical concerns for infant welfare.
 As such, it should be included in training programs that prepare residents to care for newborns.
 To assess the current level of DPNB use by residents in a family practice training program and to identify attitudes and other factors that relate to use, a survey was sent to 127 residents in the Department of Family Practice and Community Health, University of Minnesota.
 Of the 101 respondents, 55% had used DPNB, and 17% could be characterized as high users, employing the technique for over one half of the circumcisions they performed.
 Residents with comprehensive understanding of the newborn's capacity to feel pain were more likely to be using DPNB than their less well-informed counterparts.
 Four factors were identified as predicting use: cooperation of nursery staff for the procedure, accessibility of instruction in PNB technique, belief that PNB is effective in reducing infant pain, and likelihood of parents giving consent for PNB.
 These results suggest strategies which may be implemented by family practice educators who wish to promote the principles and techniques of DPNB.

"Vagal modulation of the rate-dependent properties of the atrioventricular node.
 Vagal effects on atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction are accentuated by increases in heart rate.
 To establish the mechanism of these rate-dependent negative dromotropic actions, we studied the properties governing AV nodal adaptation to changes in heart rate in chloralose-anesthetized dogs in the absence and presence of bilateral cervical vagal nerve stimulation (20 Hz, 0.2 msec).
 Stimulation protocols were applied to evaluate the contributions of changes in AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue independently of each other.
 Vagal stimulation slowed AV nodal recovery in a voltage-dependent way, increasing the time constant of recovery (tau r) from 80 +/- 7 to 194 +/- 16 msec (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) at the highest voltage studied.
 The facilitating effect of a premature (A2) beat was manifested by a leftward shift of the recovery curve (A3H3 versus H2A3) of a subsequent A3 beat.
 The magnitude of shift depended on the A1A2 coupling interval and was reduced by vagal stimulation at all A1A2 intervals (maximum shift: control, 63 +/- 12 msec; vagus, 24 +/- 11 msec; p less than 0.01).
 When recovery and facilitation were kept constant, abrupt increases in AV nodal activation rate caused a slow (tau = 75 beats) increase in AH interval (fatigue).
 Vagal stimulation increased the magnitude of this process (maximum: control, 11 +/- 2 msec; vagus, 27 +/- 3 msec; p less than 0.001), without altering its time course.
 At activation rates comparable to sinus rhythm in humans, vagal stimulation at an intermediate voltage increased the AH interval by 25 msec.
 As heart rate increased, vagally induced changes in dynamic processes amplified AH prolongation up to fivefold at maximum rate.
 The role of vagal changes in individual functional properties depended on heart rate, but slowing of recovery was the single most important factor, constituting over 50% of overall vagal action at rapid rates.
 We conclude that vagal stimulation alters the ways in which the AV node responds to changes in activation rate and that at rapid rates most of the negative dromotropic action of the vagus is due to changes in the AV nodal response to tachycardia.
 Alterations in rate-dependent AV nodal properties are a novel and potentially important mechanism through which interventions may affect AV nodal conduction.

"Hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type. Magnetic resonance imaging findings in 7 cases.
 The clinical history and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings are presented of 7 patients with hereditary cerebral haemorrhage with amyloidosis--Dutch type (HCHWA-D).
 The diagnosis was based on clinical and genealogical data, was confirmed in 3 patients at autopsy and in 2 others by biopsy.
 Focal neurological signs, and at least some degree of global cognitive deterioration, were observed in all patients, with unequivocal dementia in 4.
 MRI showed haemorrhages and areas of gliosis and, to a variable extent, hyperintensity of the white matter in T2-weighted images.
 Neuropathological examination revealed a large recent haemorrhage together with residual lesions from previous haemorrhages or infarcts in all patients examined.
 The white matter lesions, present on MRI, turned out to be areas of 'incomplete infarction' with demyelination.
 It is concluded that (hereditary) amyloid angiopathy can lead to strokes, but also to subcortical ischaemic encephalopathy.
 Amyloid angiopathy should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of white matter lesions, found on CT or MRI, especially when patients present with a cerebral haemorrhage.
 The relationship between HCHWA-D and Alzheimer's disease, another disease with cerebral amyloid deposition and diffuse white matter involvement, is discussed.

"An evaluation of cocaine-induced chest pain 
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine if enzymatic evidence of acute myocardial injury is present in patients complaining of chest pain after cocaine use when the ECG is normal or nondiagnostic.
 DESIGN: Serial ECG and creatinine kinase (CK) and CK isoenzymes (CK-ISO) determinations were performed at time of emergency department presentation and every six hours over 12 hours on individuals complaining of chest pain within six hours of last cocaine use.
 SETTING: ED of an urban tertiary care center.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two individuals with a mean age of 28.5 years.
 INTERVENTIONS: Patients with positive CK-ISOs were admitted immediately to formally rule out myocardial infarction.
 Patients developing ECG changes during observation period also were admitted even if CK-ISOs were normal.
 Patients with unchanged ECGs and normal CK-ISOs were discharged after 12 hours of observation.
 RESULTS: Eight patients (19%) had elevated CK and CK-ISO values at presentation.
 Two of these patients had elevated values on three sequential determinations and were believed to have sustained acute myocardial infarction.
 Six patients had elevated CK and CK-ISOs at presentation only.
 ECGs remained normal or nondiagnostic in all patients.
 CONCLUSIONS: Enzymatic evidence of acute myocardial injury may occur in patients who develop chest pain after cocaine use and have normal or nondiagnostic ECGs.
 This injury may reflect acute infarction or transient ischemia.
 Single or serial normal or nondiagnostic ECGs do not rule out ischemia or injury in this group of patients.

"Management of stage A prostate cancer.
 Transrectal ultrasonography has defined a new category of stage A disease, namely nonpalpable lesions diagnosed by needle biopsy.
 How this type relates to classic stage A disease is unclear.
 Stage A1 carcinoma becomes clinically significant only in a distinct minority of patients, and even in this group, progression does not necessarily mean significant morbidity or death from prostate cancer.
 An aggressive approach is not justified.
 In contrast, stage A2 cancer is usually virulent, and aggressive therapy with curative intent is justified in patients of appropriate age and health.
 Both radical prostatectomy and external irradiation appear to provide long-term survival rates superior to those obtained with observation alone, but nearly 20% of these patients will die of cancer despite therapy.
 Unfortunately, forecasting the outcome in an individual case is still not possible, and efforts to identify prognostic features must continue.
 In the meantime, emotional arguments in favor of the treatment of all discovered cancers must be suppressed by an informed and objective understanding of the natural history of nonpalpable prostate cancer and the potential impact of treatment.

"Electroencephalography laboratory diagnosis of prolonged QT interval.
 Patients with prolongation of the QT interval are at risk for significant neurological morbidity and mortality secondary to ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
 These patients frequently undergo electroencephalographic (EEG) examination to evaluate episodes of loss of consciousness, which may be associated with convulsions.
 Electrocardiogram recording as a part of the EEG is a simple and common practice, but analysis for possible QT prolongation is not routinely performed by electroencephalographers.
 This is, in part, due to the fact that while calculation of the corrected QT interval is straight forward, a calculator is generally required.
 A nomogram that is presented simplifies determination of the corrected QT interval, facilitating diagnosis of prolongation of the QT interval in the EEG laboratory.

"Effect of gastric mucus on the uptake of the carcinogen MNNG by gastric mucosal DNA.
 In prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-, pirenzepine-, and indomethacin-administered rats, the incorporation of N-[methyl-3H]-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine ([methyl-3H]MNNG) into gastric mucosal DNA was measured quantitatively by liquid scintillation counting after intragastric instillation of [methyl-3H]MNNG.
 The amount of incorporation was 25.4 +/- 5.9 pmol/mg DNA in control rats, 11.7 +/- 3.8 pmol/mg DNA in PGE2-administered rats, 6.2 +/- 5.6 pmol/mg DNA in pirenzepine-administered rats, and 42.9 +/- 14.4 pmol/mg DNA in indomethacin-administered rats.
 PGE2 and pirenzepine significantly decreased the incorporation as compared with the control group.
 In contrast, indomethacin increased the incorporation.
 In addition, gastric mucosa of these drug-treated rats was studied histochemically.
 PGE2 and pirenzepine increased secretion of gastric mucus whereas indomethacin decreased it.
 It is possible that gastric mucus has a protective effect not only against ulcerogenic agents but also against carcinogens.
 It is considered that gastric mucus plays an important role in the defense mechanism against carcinogenesis.

"Immune complexes in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were analyzed in a cohort of 30 children infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
 Elevated CIC were detected by the C1q assay in 70% (21/30) of all patients and by the Raji cell assay in 93% (28/30) of all patients.
 While only less than one third of patients with elevated CIC had free serum antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus, 80% (16/20) of them had detectable antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus associated with CIC.
 Enriched CIC in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children contained low levels of complement.
 These findings document that, as an expression of the humoral immunodeficiency, CIC in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children are deficient in complement and can thus be underestimated if complement-precipitating methods are used for their detection.

"Bactericidal effect of doxycycline associated with lysosomotropic agents on Coxiella burnetii in P388D1 cells.
 There is no consistently reliable treatment for endocarditis resulting from chronic Coxiella burnetii infection, the causative agent of Q fever.
 Although certain antibiotics are recommended on the basis of their in vitro bactericidal activities, results of therapy with these antibiotics are often disappointing.
 To evaluate whether the currently recommended antibiotic susceptibility tests for C.
 burnetii give misleading results because of continued division of uninfected cells, thereby resulting in the dilution of infected cells and, hence, a false picture of antibiotic efficacy, we blocked cell division during antibiotic susceptibility testing with cycloheximide.
 Using this new method, we found that the currently recommended antibiotics for the treatment of Q fever, doxycycline, pefloxacin, and rifampin, did not reduce the ratio of infected to noninfected cells (either L929 or P388D1) by 9 days postinfection.
 To test the hypothesis that this lack of antibacterial activity is due to antibiotic inactivation by the low pH of the phagolysosomes in which C.
 burnetii is found, we used alkalinizing lysosomotropic agents (chloroquine or amantadine) concurrently with doxycycline.
 This resulted in the sterilization of C.
 burnetii infection in P388D1 cells.
 This finding seems to confirm our suspicion that the acidic conditions of the phagolysosomes in which C.
 burnetii is located inhibit antibiotic activity.
 This inhibition can be reversed in vitro when lysosomotropic alkalinizing agents are used.

"Response of angiographically normal and atherosclerotic left anterior descending coronary arteries to acetylcholine.
 Acetylcholine-induced constriction of human coronary arteries in vivo is commonly attributed to endothelial dysfunction.
 To examine the effects of 2 other important determinants of vascular responses--namely, agonist concentration and the segment of circulation under study--the diameters of proximal, middle and distal segments of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and coronary sinus oxygen saturation were measured in 10 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 7 patients with coronary atherosclerosis (group 2) after intracoronary acetylcholine was infused at concentrations from 10(-7)M to between 10(-4)M and 10(-2)M.
 In group 1, acetylcholine caused minor (less than or equal to 6%) but progressive dilatation of the LAD up to 10(-4)M, but constriction, particularly of the distal segments and tertiary branches, occurred at higher concentrations.
 Over the same concentration range, coronary sinus oxygen saturation rose progressively from a basal level of 36 +/- 3% to a maximum of 72 +/- 3% in the absence of changes in heart rate and blood pressure, suggesting marked progressive dilatation of resistance vessels.
 Concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-3)M caused intense constriction of distal epicardial vessels and, in some cases, anginal pain and objective signs of ischemia.
 Conversely, in group 2, acetylcholine (infused only up to 10(-4)M for ethical reasons) failed to cause significant changes in LAD diameter.
 These data suggest that the local acetylcholine concentration and coronary vascular segment under study may determine the observed response to at least an equivalent extent as does the presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis, raising the question of whether a constrictor response to intracoronary acetylcholine reliably indicates the presence of coronary atherosclerosis.

"Complications in hyperthermia treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 Of 435 patients treated with local hyperthermia to the prostate 27 had 29 complications, for an over-all complication rate of 6.6%.
 Urinary tract infections (7 cases), hematuria (6), and epididymitis (2) accounted for roughly half of the complications and could be attributed to the insertion of a catheter rather than the treatment itself but this remains to be proved.
 Most of the complications occurred within the first 3 treatment sessions.
 Despite the complication, 9 patients continued and completed the treatment course.
 Mean age of the study group was 73 +/- 8.3 years.
 Given the age of these patients, high incidence of accompanying diseases and low rate of complications, local hyperthermia should be considered a viable low risk treatment option in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.

"A prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to compare the efficacy and safety of chronic nifedipine therapy with that of isosorbide dinitrate and their combination in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure 
 We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study to compare the efficacy and safety of vasodilation with the calcium entry blocker nifedipine with that of isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) and their combination as treatment for heart failure.
 Twenty-eight patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III chronic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction were studied.
 All patients were maintained on a constant dose of digitalis and diuretics throughout the study.
 Eight weeks of therapy with nifedipine alone or in combination with ISDN resulted in a significantly higher incidence of heart failure deterioration necessitating hospitalizations and/or additional diuretics.
 Twenty-four percent of patients required hospitalization during nifedipine therapy and 26% required hospitalization during nifedipine-ISDN combination therapy in comparison to 0% requiring hospitalization during ISDN therapy alone.
 The total number of heart failure-worsening episodes was nine among patients on nifedipine, three among patients on ISDN (p less than 0.09 versus nifedipine), and 21 among patients on nifedipine-ISDN combination (p less than 0.001 versus nifedipine, p less than 0.0001 versus ISDN).
 Premature discontinuation of drug administration due to clinical deterioration or other side effects occurred in 29% of patients during nifedipine therapy, 5% of patients during ISDN therapy (p = 0.05 versus nifedipine), and 19% of patients during the combination therapy.
 A comparison of eight patients who demonstrated clinical deterioration on nifedipine with the remainder of the patients demonstrated no significant difference in left ventricular ejection fraction (0.24 +/- 0.06 versus 0.23 +/- 0.07) or maximal oxygen uptake during exercise (13 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 ml/kg/min).

"The role of human immunodeficiency virus infection in pneumococcal bacteremia in San Francisco residents.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an important risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease, but information on clinical course and infecting serotypes is limited.
 To help develop strategies to reduce the morbidity due to invasive pneumococcal disease, episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia were identified by retrospective review of microbiology records (November 1983-November 1987) at 10 San Francisco hospitals and, for patients 20-55 years old living in San Francisco, HIV antibody status was determined by review of medical records.
 Pneumococcal isolates from one hospital were serotyped.
 Of 294 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia identified, 32 (11%) had AIDS at the time pneumococcal bacteremia was diagnosed and another 43 (15%) were HIV-infected but did not have AIDS; 12 HIV-infected patients developed AIDS after the episode of pneumococcal bacteremia.
 The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia in AIDS patients was estimated to be 9.4/1000 patient-years.
 Serotypes of 27 (82%) of 33 pneumococcal isolates from HIV-infected patients and 107 (90%) from 119 patients without known HIV infection were among the 23 serotypes included in the currently available polysaccharide vaccine.
 The rate of pneumococcal bacteremia is approximately 100-fold greater in AIDS patients in San Francisco than rates reported before the AIDS epidemic, but more than half the episodes of pneumococcal bacteremia in HIV-infected patients occurred in patients without AIDS.
 Data on pneumococcal serotypes causing invasive disease in HIV-infected patients suggest that the current pneumococcal vaccine, if effective in this population, could provide significant protection against pneumococcal disease.

"Secondary T-cell lymphoproliferation after marrow transplantation.
 Secondary lymphoproliferative syndromes in immunosuppressed patients have been characterized as polyclonal or monoclonal B-lineage disorders nearly always associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.
 The authors now report three patients with a distinctly different lymphoproliferative syndrome.
 Two patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA) (CD10)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia, respectively, received high-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by marrow transplantation from either an HLA-identical sibling or HLA-mismatched parent.
 All three patients developed severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), requiring immunosuppressive treatment with corticosteroids.
 A secondary malignant T-cell lymphoproliferation occurred 2, 21, and 43 months, respectively, after marrow transplantation.
 In all three cases the lymphoid cells expressed T-cell surface antigens and were morphologically and immunophenotypically distinct from the malignant cells present before transplantation.
 One tumor was of host cell origin, one was probably of donor origin, and the tumor origin in the third case could not be determined.
 The authors were unable to find any evidence for EBV, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I or II, human immunodeficiency virus, or human herpesvirus 6.

"Comparison of two methods for the estimation of urea kinetics and introduction of a third simplified method.
 It has been claimed that computed urea kinetic (UK) modelling in hemodialysed patients, for the estimation of protein intake, leads to an overestimation of protein catabolic rate (PCR).
 In the present study, three different methods of kinetic modelling for the determination of PCR and Kt/V are compared in 24 patients.
 The first method was the direct quantification method (DDQ) based on the collection of all urea eliminated from the body.
 The first computed method (ICMI) was the urea kinetic modelling method as described by Sargent.
 Dialyzer clearances were measured directly and not estimated by theoretical extrapolation.
 The second computed method (ICMII) is based on the indirect calculation of urea distribution volume (Vu), according to Watson, and of dialyzer clearances from this Vu and from pre- and post-dialysis urea concentrations.
 All three methods resulted in PCR's that were not significantly different (DDQ: 1.03 +/- 0.19; ICMI: 1.04 +/- 0.22; ICMII: 1.08 +/- 0.25 mg/Kg BW.24 hrs; p greater than 0.05).
 When the results were correlated, the following results were obtained: ICMI vs ICMII: r = 0.89, p less than 0.001; ICMI vs DDQ: r = 0.68, p less than 0.01; DDQ vs ICMII: r = 0.78, p less than 0.001.
 Intermutual comparison of Kt/V values resulted in virtually identical results, especially when comparing ICMI and ICMII, where the regression line equalled the identity line.
 In conclusion, all methods seem equally reliable in determining mean PCR and Kt/V.
 Our data, obtained with directly measured dialyzer urea clearances, do not confirm the earlier held opinion that computed modelling results in an overestimation of PCR.

"Hyperglycemia-induced B cell toxicity. The fate of pancreatic islets transplanted into diabetic mice is dependent on their genetic background.
 The role of pancreatic B cell dysfunction in the phase preceding clinical onset of insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has been much debated.
 In this investigation, the impact of a prolonged diabetic environment on pancreatic islet B cells transplanted syngeneically under the kidney capsule of C57BL/6 (B6) and C57BL/Ks (BKs) mice was studied.
 Alloxan-diabetic mice bearing a subcapsular islet graft insufficient to normalize the blood glucose level were rendered normoglycemic by a second intrasplenic islet graft after various period of hyperglycemia to examine the reversibility of hyperglycemia-induced B cell dysfunction.
 Using a perfusion technique of the graft-bearing, it was found that both strains of mice exhibited a diminished glucose-induced insulin secretion after 6 wk of hyperglycemia, when compared with normoglycemic mice carrying islet grafts.
 When normoglycemia was restituted by the splenic graft after 4 or 12 wk, there was a normalization of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in the renal islet grafts in B6 mice, whereas insulin secretion from the grafted BKs islets remained impaired.
 Morphometric measurements of the islet grafts demonstrated a 50% reduction in the graft volume in diabetic BKs mice after 12 wk, compared with normoglycemic animals, whereas no such decrease was observed in B6 mice.
 Islet grafts removed from hyperglycemic mice of both strains exhibited diminished insulin mRNA contents, and in the BKs mice there was also a reduced glucose oxidation rate in the islet grafts in vitro.
 This metabolic dysfunction can only partly be explained by a reduced graft size.
 The present findings emphasize the genetic constitution as a decisive factor for the survival and function during a period of sustained stress on a limited B cell mass.

 The field has evolved rapidly and provides an example of fruitful clinical investigation: the original problem was a clinical one (the HHM syndrome); understanding the clinical disorder led to pursuit of the problem in the laboratory (adenylate cyclase assays, protein purification, molecular cloning, PTHRP synthesis); and observations made in the laboratory have rapidly yielded clinical fruits (PTHRP immunoassays) and opened a new window on normal physiology.

 To analyze whether corticosteroids in low doses during limited time periods could be safely used in the treatment of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) or temporal arteritis (TA) the records of 91 patients diagnosed between 1980 and 1987 were reviewed.
 The mean initial prednisolone dose was in patients with PMR 18 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment was 17 months.
 In patients with TA the mean initial dose was 31 mg/day and the mean duration of treatment 16 months, and in all the corticosteroid treatment was terminated within 24 months.
 Patients with coexisting TA and PMR demanded longer treatment compared to patients with either TA or PMR and thus 18/91 patients were treated for more than 2 years.
 No visual or neurological complications occurred after treatment with corticosteroids had been initiated.
 Our study indicates that most patients with PMR or TA can be treated safely with an initial prednisolone dose of 10 mg given twice daily.

 We evaluated 109 women with endometrial carcinoma to determine the accuracy of preoperative tumor-associated antigen levels (CA 125, CA 72, CA 15-3) for prediction of extrauterine disease and whether TAG 72, CA 15-3, or both would improve the predictive value of CA 125 alone.
 Eleven (12%) of 80 patients with disease confined to the uterus or positive cytologic findings had CA 125 values greater than 35 U/ml versus 12 (65%) of 20 patients with extrauterine metastasis.
 Therefore CA 125 values had sensitivity of 65% and specificity of 88%.
 The TAG 72 level was elevated (greater than 6 U/ml) in 4% of patients with localized disease and 30% with metastasis.
 CA 15-3 was elevated (greater than 30 U/ml) in 17% and 65% in these categories, respectively.
 TAG 72 or CA 15-3 levels did not improve the combination of sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 alone.
 In addition, only one of 10 patients with microscopic metastasis (three cases) or positive peritoneal cytology (seven) had elevation of any of these tumor-associated antigen levels.

"Sickle erythrocytes inhibit human endothelial cell DNA synthesis.
 Patients with sickle cell anemia experience severe vascular occlusive phenomena including acute pain crisis and cerebral infarction.
 Obstruction occurs at both the microvascular and the arterial level, and the clinical presentation of vascular events is heterogeneous, suggesting a complex etiology.
 Interaction between sickle erythrocytes and the endothelium may contribute to vascular occlusion due to alteration of endothelial function.
 To investigate this hypothesis, human vascular endothelial cells were overlaid with sickle or normal erythrocytes and stimulated to synthesize DNA.
 The erythrocytes were sedimented onto replicate monolayers by centrifugation for 10 minutes at 17 g to insure contact with the endothelial cells.
 Incorporation of 3H-thymidine into endothelial cell DNA was markedly inhibited during contact with sickle erythrocytes.
 This inhibitory effect was enhanced more than twofold when autologous sickle plasma was present during endothelial cell labeling.
 Normal erythrocytes, with or without autologous plasma, had a modest effect on endothelial cell DNA synthesis.
 When sickle erythrocytes in autologous sickle plasma were applied to endothelial monolayers for 1 minute, 10 minutes, or 1 hour and then removed, subsequent DNA synthesis by the endothelial cells was inhibited by 30% to 40%.
 Although adherence of sickle erythrocytes to the endothelial monolayers was observed under these experimental conditions, the effect of sickle erythrocytes on endothelial DNA synthesis occurred in the absence of significant adherence.
 Hence, human endothelial cell DNA synthesis is partially inhibited by contact with sickle erythrocytes.
 The inhibitory effect of sickle erythrocytes occurs during a brief (1 minute) contact with the endothelial monolayers, and persists for at least 6 hours of 3H-thymidine labeling.
 These results indicate that interaction between sickle erythrocytes and the endothelium may result in altered endothelial function.
 This altered endothelial function may contribute to the development of vascular occlusive phenomena in patients with sickle cell anemia.

"Home treatment for acute psychiatric illness 
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the factors influencing the successful outcome of community treatment for severe acute psychiatric illnesses that are traditionally treated in hospital.
 DESIGN--All patients from a single electoral ward who were either admitted to hospital or treated at home over a two year period (1 October 1987 to 30 September 1989) were included in the study and their case notes audited.
 The second year of the study is reported.
 SETTING--Electoral ward of Sparkbrook, Birmingham.
 SUBJECTS--99 Patients aged 16-65 with severe acute psychiatric illness.
 RESULTS--65 Patients were managed by home treatment alone; 34 required admission to hospital.
 The location of treatment was significantly (all p less than 0.05) influenced by social characteristics of the patients (marital state, age (in men), ethnicity, and living alone) and by characteristics of the referral (occurring out of hours; assessment taking place at hospital or police station).
 DSM-III-R diagnosis was more weakly associated with outcome.
 Violence during the episode was significantly related to admission, although deliberate self harm was not.
 CONCLUSIONS--Home treatment is feasible for most patients with acute psychiatric illness.
 A 24 hour on call assessment service increases the likelihood of success because admission is determined more strongly by social characteristics of the patient and the referral than by illness factors.
 Admission will still be required for some patients.
 A locally based mental health resource centre, a 24 hour on call service, an open referral system, and an active follow up policy increase the effectiveness of a home treatment service.

 A cumulative total of 89 h of pressure data was acquired from both sides of a left colonic anastomosis in 15 patients over a median period of 7 postoperative study days.
 Patients had a colonic ileus lasting 3-10 days and during this proximal and distal inactivity the intraluminal pressure remained within 6 mmHg of atmospheric pressure.
 After recovery of activity, pressures proximal to the anastomosis in excess of 10 mmHg occurred during less than 1 per cent of the recording time.
 Distal peak pressures were significantly elevated with respect to the proximal site (P less than 0.001).
 Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg.

"Effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on lung vascular permeability and resistance.
 The effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on pulmonary vascular permeability and resistance was studied in 25 isolated blood-perfused dog lungs.
 Vascular permeability, assessed by determining filtration coefficient (Kf), and vascular resistances were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment.
 Ischemia reperfusion was produced by occluding blood flow to the lung for 3 h and reperfusing for 1 h, whereas hypoxia reoxygenation was obtained by ventilating the lung with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 3 h and then ventilating with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 1 h with no interruption of perfusion.
 There was a significant increase in Kf in both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation groups (51 and 85%, respectively), and total vascular resistance increased greatly in both groups (386 and 532%, respectively).
 Two additional groups were also studied in which the ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation lungs were pretreated with allopurinol (20 micrograms/ml).
 The Kf did not significantly increase in either the allopurinol ischemia reperfusion or the allopurinol hypoxia reoxygenation groups (22 and 6%, respectively).
 However, total vascular resistance significantly increased in both groups (239 and 224%, respectively).
 Although vascular permeability is modestly increased by both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation, the predominant change in these conditions is the increased vascular resistance, which predominantly affects the postcapillary resistance and would result in a greater tendency for edema to develop in these slightly damaged lungs.
 Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, attenuated the permeability changes in both groups and may be useful in preventing ischemia reperfusion injury in certain conditions.

"Lymphocyte trafficking in psoriasis: a new perspective emphasizing the dermal dendrocyte with active dermal recruitment mediated via endothelial cells followed by intra-epidermal T-cell activation.
 Prominent within the inflammatory infiltrate of psoriasis are HLA-DR positive T lymphocytes and factor XIIIa positive dermal dendrocytes.
 Many investigators studying psoriasis have assumed that the HLA-DR positive T cells are activated, and thereby capable of producing lymphokines such as gamma interferon.
 However, by immunohistochemical analysis, greater than 95% of the dermal T cells in psoriatic lesions are Ki-67 negative, which suggests that they are in a resting or non-cycling (Go) state.
 In contrast to the dermal T-cell population, the epidermal T-cell population contains a greater population of Ki-67 positive lymphocytes.
 The entry of the T cells into the epidermis is, therefore, apparently associated with an important activation event, which in all likelihood involves interaction with the keratinocyte.
 The presence of activated intraepidermal T cells has been substantiated by the ability to detect gamma interferon mRNA by polymerase chain reaction in epidermal sheets of psoriatic lesions.
 The pathophysiologic implication in psoriasis for these distinctions and compartmentalization involving dermal and epidermal T cells are placed into the context of a cascade of cellular trafficking events, which are further dissected into a specific network of molecular mediators of inflammation.
 This report suggests that more attention should be placed on the microenvironment of the skin, with specific emphasis on the mechanism by which T cells accumulate in the dermis and epidermis, and elucidation of the selective inductive and recruitment capabilities of endothelial cells, perivascular dermal dendrocytes, and keratinocytes.

"The patellofemoral joint after total knee arthroplasty without patellar resurfacing.
 One hundred total knee replacements with a total condylar prosthesis and without patellar resurfacing were followed for a minimum of two years.
 Eighty-four per cent of the knees were affected by osteoarthrosis.
 Graded according to the knee-rating system of the Hospital for Special Surgery, there were eighteen excellent, fifty-three good, eighteen fair, and eleven poor results.
 At the most recent follow-up, twenty-nine knees (29 per cent), nine of which were affected by rheumatoid arthritis, were still painful in the patellofemoral area.
 The height and weight of the patient definitely influenced the amount of patellofemoral pain postoperatively.
 Small patients who had osteoarthrosis were exceptionally free of pain, regardless of sex, age, or level of activity.
 It seems that the best approach to patellofemoral replacement includes resurfacing of the patella in all patients who have rheumatoid arthritis and in patients who have osteoarthrosis if they have preoperative patellofemoral pain, are more than 160 centimeters tall, weigh more than sixty kilograms, and have advanced changes in the patella at the time of the operation.

"Human recombinant GM-CSF in allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation for leukaemia: double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 In a randomised, double-blind trial 20 patients with leukaemia received human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 20 received placebo, for 14 days after allogeneic, matched sibling, bone-marrow transplantation.
 The neutrophil count recovered to 0.5 x 10(9)/l 3 days earlier in the GM-CSF group than in the placebo group (not significant), and the median neutrophil count at 14 days was significantly higher in the GM-CSF group (1.90 vs 0.46 x 10(9)/l).
 The lymphocyte count was significantly higher in the GM-CSF than in the placebo group between days 10 and 15 after transplantation, but this difference was not associated with a higher incidence of graft-versus-host disease.
 There was no evidence that GM-CSF was associated with a greater incidence of leukaemic relapse.
 The GM-CSF group had lower haemoglobin concentrations and platelet counts and higher plasma urea, creatinine, and bilirubin than the placebo group.
 The duration of hospital stay was the same for both patient groups.
 Further studies are now indicated to assess the overall effect of GM-CSF on outcome after allogeneic bone-marrow transplantation.

"Changes affecting the initial evaluation and care of the pregnant trauma victim.
 Pregnant women in American society today are at significant risk of injury during a period when physiologic responses to trauma, as well as expected findings of physical examination and laboratory evaluation are altered by the on-going pregnancy.
 Changes in anatomy, hemodynamics, respiratory function, gastrointestinal function, and hematologic and hemostatic parameters impact upon the approach to the evaluation and management of injured pregnant women.
 Maternal outcome is dependent on the nature and extent of injury and on the delivery of appropriate care.
 Fetal outcome relates to the magnitude of direct injury and the maternal physiologic response.
 It is imperative that all physicians involved in clinical evaluation and management of injured pregnant women understand the changes engendered by pregnancy and their effects upon the mother, the fetus, and the decision-making process.
 The best way to secure a favorable outcome for both mother and fetus is a standardized planned approach to care provided by a team cognizant of these changes.

 This patient underwent laparotomy and tumour resection without complication.
 Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam, fentanyl, and vecuronium, and maintained with isoflurane as well as additional fentanyl and vecuronium.
 However, we feel that it was the use of octreotide that prevented a life-threatening crisis intraoperatively, and recommend its use in patients with carcinoid syndrome undergoing anaesthesia and surgery.

"Digital rectal examination in the early detection of prostate cancer.
 Screening using digital rectal examination improves the clinical stage distribution of prostate cancer and prolongs survival.
 Unfortunately, digital rectal examination may not be sensitive enough to detect the small-volume tumors that are most amenable to cure.
 In several studies, approximately 50 per cent of cancers detected through screening had already spread beyond the prostate.
 Regardless, the key to demonstrating overall benefit from screening is a diminished disease-specific mortality rate.
 To date, this has not been shown.
 Lower mortality rates from prostate cancer can be demonstrated only through a randomized study comparing screened and unscreened populations.
 Such a study, which has recently been approved and funded by the National Institutes of Health, will require 10 to 15 years to complete.
 Until that time, the value of screening for prostate cancer by digital rectal examination or any other method will be unknown.
 Beyond a lack of proved benefit, screening for prostate cancer may be harmful because of the variable natural history of the disease and the morbidity and mortality rates associated with treatment.
 There exists a large population of patients with pathologically detectable prostate cancer who will never have clinical disease.
 The detection of some of these tumors may expose those patients to the risks of unnecessary treatment.
 Large-scale prostate cancer screening studies may ultimately be shown to be advantageous.
 The sooner this occurs, the earlier aggressive screening can be advocated, similar to screening for breast cancer.
 However, the temptation to embark on such screening programs without first demonstrating clear benefit should be resisted.

"Effects of inflammatory mediators on the responsiveness of isolated human airways to methacholine.
 Several studies have suggested that in asthmatics the quantities of inflammatory mediators such as histamine, thromboxane A2 (TxA2), prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and leukotriene C4 (LTC4) that are present in the airway lumen are related to the degree of bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine (MCh).
 Therefore, we studied the effect of these mediators on the cholinergic responsiveness of isolated human airway segments.
 Lung tissue collected at thoracotomy from 30 patients was studied.
 Dose-response curves to MCh were obtained from bronchial segments before, during, and after incubation with either a subthreshold or a threshold concentration of histamine (10(-10) or 10(-8) M), the stable TxA2 analogue U46619 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M), PGD2 (5 x 10(-9) or 5 x 10(-7) M), PGF2 alpha (10(-9) or 10(-7) M), or LTC4 (10(-11) or 10(-9) M).
 With the exception of LTC4, the presence of any of these mediators at either concentration increased the sensitivity to MCh by a factor of 1.1 to 2 (p less than 0.05, ANOVA).
 This increase did not depend on the dose of the mediator (p greater than 0.05, ANOVA).
 These data indicate that mediator-induced muscle hypersensitivity can explain a small part of the leftward shift of the dose-response curve to inhaled MCh as observed in asthma.

"Functional results of facial nerve suture after removal of acoustic neurinoma: analysis of 25 cases.
 The facial nerve is sometimes severed during the removal of acoustic neurinomas, either intentionally to ensure complete removal, or unintentionally because of difficulties in identification.
 In such cases we have, if possible, sutured the nerve stumps microsurgically, either end to end or by use of an intervening nerve graft.
 We analyzed the outcome of 25 instances of facial nerve suturing in a series of 219 patients operated on for acoustic neurinoma from 1979 to 1987.
 The first signs of recovery appeared at an average of 12 months, and there was continued improvement for several years.
 Recovery was graded from 1 to 6.
 The anastomosis was successful in 24 of the 25 sutured nerves, in that at least some facial movement and tone were restored (Grade 5 or higher).
 In 11 of the 25 cases, facial appearance at rest and with movement was moderately good (Grade 2 or 3).
 A Grade 1 result, with no perceivable facial dysfunction, was never achieved.
 Typically, oral muscles showed the most improvement and frontal muscles the least.
 Facial appearance was better at rest than with movement, which was always complicated by some degree of synkinesis.
 Closure of the eye was so good in 13 of the 25 cases that neither tarsorrhaphy nor an eyelid spring was necessary.
 When the facial nerve is severed, intraoperative suture is recommended, because it provides a chance for moderately good restoration of facial appearance.

"A comparison of familial and nonfamilial male alcoholic patients without a coexisting psychiatric disorder.
 Both family history of alcoholism and the presence of additional psychiatric disorder in male alcoholic patients are associated with an earlier onset of problem drinking, greater alcoholism severity and poorer clinical outcomes.
 To assess the relative contribution of family history alone, a sample of 212 male alcoholics not positive for any other psychiatric disorder was selected and divided into those with a family history of alcoholism (FH+) or no family history of alcoholism (FH-) among first degree relatives.
 Although FH+ alcoholics reported a younger age of onset of problem drinking and greater severity of some alcohol-related sequelae, the differences were not as extensive or pronounced as those found in a previous study of a sample of psychiatrically heterogeneous patients (Penick et al., 1987).
 A bi-dimensional typology of alcoholism incorporating both additional psychiatric diagnoses and a positive family history of alcoholism is suggested.

"Natural and modified history of complete atrioventricular septal defect--a 17 year study.
 We reviewed 103 cases of isolated complete atrioventricular septal defect.
 These cases represented 4.4% of the cases of congenital heart disease diagnosed in our hospital by catheterisation and angiography during 1971-88.
 Most children (n = 76) had Down's syndrome.
 Banding of the pulmonary artery was performed in seven cases and complete repair in 67 cases.
 In the period 1971-82 the complete correction was performed at a mean age of 23 months with a surgical mortality of 88.8%.
 In the period 1983-8 the mean age at complete correction was 13 months, the mortality 43.2%, and the five year actuarial survival was 46.8%.
 The 22 patients that survived after complete correction were in functional classes I and II of the New York Heart Association classification.
 After a mean follow up of 10 years only eight (36%) of the 22 who were followed up and treated medically survived; all had developed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease and were in functional classes III or IV.
 Our findings stress the importance of early complete surgical repair.

"Ultrasonography compared with intravenous urography in the investigation of adults with haematuria 
 OBJECTIVE--To compare ultrasonography with intravenous urography in the investigation of adults with haematuria.
 DESIGN--Prospective study entailing the examination of all patients with both investigations concurrently.
 The investigations were performed independently on routine lists by different duty radiologists.
 Each was aware of the details of the request form but not of the findings of the other investigation.
 SETTING--Radiology department of a teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS--155 Consecutive adult patients (aged 18-93) referred from general practitioners and hospital outpatient clinics with a history of haematuria.
 FOLLOW UP--When results of both examinations proved normal no clinical or radiological follow up was sought.
 All abnormal findings of either investigation were correlated with results of subsequent imaging studies or operative findings.
 RESULTS--81 Patients (52%) had normal findings on urography and ultrasonography.
 Overall, the findings of ultrasonography concurred with those of urography in 144 cases (93%).
 Among the discrepant findings of the two investigations ultrasonography missed two ureteric calculi; one was in a non-dilated ureter, and in the other case ultrasonography detected the secondary ureteric dilatation.
 Ultrasound examination alone detected four bladder tumours not visible on urography with sizes ranging from 5 to 21 mm, representing one fifth of the 20 cystoscopically proved bladder tumours detected in the series.
 Ultrasonography detected all the 22 neoplastic lesions discovered in the study (20 bladder, two renal).
 Ultrasonography clarified the nature of renal masses evident in three urograms (simple cysts).
 CONCLUSIONS--Ultrasonography is a safe and accurate method of investigating the urinary tract in adults with haematuria.
 When combined with a single plain abdominal radiograph it proved to be superior to urography as the primary imaging study in this series.
 Ultrasonography should certainly be preferred to urography if cystoscopy is not planned.
 No urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract were found in the series, reflecting their rarity.
 For those patients in whom ultrasonography and plain radiography have shown no abnormality and in whom cystoscopic appearances are normal urography would be advisable to exclude urothelial tumours of the upper urinary tract.

"A phase I study of a new cisplatin derivative for hematologic malignancies.
 DWA2114R (DWA) is a new derivative of platin compounds that is currently being used in Phase II studies of solid tumors in Japan.
 The dose-limiting factor is myelotoxicity with mild extramedullary toxicity.
 This Phase I study consisted of adult patients with relapsed hematologic malignancies.
 Eight patients received a total of 15 treatment courses of DWA.
 The starting dose was 800 mg/m2 over 24 hours by continuous infusion.
 The dose was first increased to 1200 mg/m2 and then to 1600 mg/m2.
 Clinical toxicity and urinary excretion studies of DWA suggested that 1200 mg/m2/d for successive days would be the best type of administration.
 When 1200 mg/m2/d was given for 5 days, Grade 2 to 3 diarrhea and nausea and vomiting were encountered requiring parenteral fluids and nutritional support.
 This suggested that the dose-limiting factor with this schedule was gastrointestinal toxicity.
 Myelotoxicity was severe, as expected, but tolerable.
 One of the five patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) entered into complete remission and one patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in crisis returned to the chronic phase.
 A Phase II trial of DWA is warranted for hematologic malignancies, especially in myeloid diseases.

 Tissues from two patients with disseminated histiocytosis X (Letterer-Siwe disease) in which histiocytosis X cells exhibited histologic and cytologic features of malignancy were evaluated by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated nucleic acid probes to c-myc and H-ras oncogenes.
 Enhanced expression of these oncogenes was observed in mononucleated and multinucleated cells of histiocytosis X in the terminal proliferative phase but not in the early quiescent phase of Letterer-Siwe disease in both patients.

"Correlation of the structure of the transmembrane domain of the neu oncogene-encoded p185 protein with its function.
 The human homologue of the neu oncogene is frequently found in human tumors.
 Certain amino acid substitutions at position 664 in the transmembrane domain of the neu oncogene-encoded p185 protein product are known to cause malignant transformation of cells.
 Using conformational energy analysis based on ECEPP (empirical conformational energies for polypeptides program), we have previously determined the preferred three-dimensional structures for the transmembrane domain of the p185 protein with a transforming (glutamic acid) and a nontransforming (valine) substitution at the critical position 664 and found that the global minimum-energy conformation of this region in the nontransforming protein contains a sharp bend, whereas the global minimum-energy conformation for this region from the transforming protein is entirely alpha-helical.
 We now demonstrate that this result holds for other known nontransforming (glycine, histidine, tyrosine, and lysine) and transforming (glutamine) substitutions at position 664.
 Furthermore, a simple statistical thermodynamic analysis of the results indicates that approximately 85% of each of the nontransforming sequences exist with the bend at positions 664 and 665, while approximately 90% of each of the transforming sequences exist as an alpha-helix.
 About 9% of the nontransforming sequences exist as the alpha-helix.
 These results suggest that if the intracellular concentration of the normal protein is increased at least 10-fold, thereby increasing the alpha-helical form by this factor, cell transformation should result.
 This conclusion is directly supported by genetic experiments in which this level of overexpression of the normal protein was achieved with attendant cell transformation.

"Fractured and retained guide-wire fragment during coronary angioplasty--unforeseen late sequelae.
 During a difficult coronary angioplasty, the tip of the guide wire became inadvertently wedged in a distal vessel, fractured, and retained in situ.
 Because of the otherwise successful nature of the angioplasty and the patient's great risk for cardiac surgery, it was elected to leave the wire fragment in place.
 Recurrence of symptoms led to recatheterization, which in addition to restenosis of the original angioplasty site showed diffuse narrowing of the arterial segment that contained the retained wire fragment.
 This occurred despite systemic anticoagulation with Coumadin in the interval between procedures.
 Thus retained guide wire fragments in patent coronary arteries may cause arterial narrowing despite systemic anticoagulation.

"Epidemiology of prostate cancer.
 Available epidemiologic data do not allow targeting of specific populations for prostate cancer screening or early detection programs.
 Although certain strong factors have been identified (age, race, location), none sufficiently defines high-risk groups in whom recommendations should differ from those of other age-matched patients.
 Certainly, a strong familial tendency has been identified, but the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in these patients remains unclear.
 Some hypotheses on the pathogenesis of prostate cancer are possible based on the available data.
 Genetic factors appear to be permissive, as are hormonal influences, which are partially regulated by genetics.
 Environmental factors appear to be promotional in genetically susceptible men.
 Dietary fat may also be an important promotional factor in genetically susceptible men.
 Dietary factors appear to exert some influence by modulating sex hormone concentration.
 Several factors demand more investigation and understanding of the epidemiology of prostate cancer.
 The relative frequency of the disease and the increasing death rate from prostate cancer are of concern.
 The similarities in the incidence of latent prostate cancer among various groups with strong differences in the rate of clinically apparent disease raise significant issues regarding potential lifestyle or environmental promotional factors.
 Further understanding of the pathogenesis of prostate cancer may allow a refinement and definition of programs for prevention and early detection of the disease.

"Witzel pneumatic dilation for achalasia: safety and long-term efficacy 
 Forceful dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter is considered primary therapy for achalasia.
 The Witzel pneumatic balloon dilator, unlike fluoroscopically placed dilators, is placed over a standard gastroscope allowing positioning and dilation under direct vision.
 We report our experience with the Witzel dilator in 45 patients with achalasia over a 5-year period.
 All patients had at least one major symptom score of 8 out of 10 for dysphagia and/or regurgitation before dilation.
 After Witzel dilation, symptomatic response was graded as excellent (score 0 to 2), good (score 3 to 5), fair (score 6 to 8), and poor (no improvement).
 Symptom response was assessed after 1 week, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, and present.
 The mean period of follow-up was 25 months (range, 3 to 85 months).
 Passage of the balloon across the gastroesophageal junction was technically unsuccessful in three patients.
 Esophageal perforation occurred in two patients (4%) and transient chest pain greater than 2 days in three patients (7%).
 There was no bleeding or death.
 Symptomatic long-term improvement was excellent in 25 patients (63%), good in 6 patients (15%), fair in 4 patients (10%), and poor in 5 patients (12%).
 A repeat Witzel dilation was performed in five patients but resulted in good/excellent improvement in only one patient.
 We conclude that pneumatic dilation with the Witzel balloon is a safe, effective procedure for achalasia.

"Restenosis after balloon angioplasty. A practical proliferative model in porcine coronary arteries.
 A model of proliferative human restenosis was developed in domestic pigs by using deep injury to the coronary arterial media.
 Metal wire coils were delivered percutaneously to the coronary arteries of 11 pigs with an oversized, high-pressure (14 atm) balloon and were left in place for times ranging from 28 to 70 days.
 During placement, the balloon expanded the coils and delivered them securely within the arterial lumen.
 Light microscopic examination of the vessels confirmed fracture of the internal elastic lamina by the coil.
 An extensive proliferative response occurred in 10 of the 11 pigs and was associated with a luminal area narrowing of at least 50% in all but one pig.
 The histopathologic features of the proliferative response were identical to those observed in human cases of restenosis after angioplasty.
 Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the prominence of smooth muscle cells in the proliferative tissue.
 A similar response was obtained in two of five porcine coronary arteries in which balloon inflation only was performed, without coil implant.
 This model is practical and inexpensive and closely mimics the proliferative portion of human restenosis both grossly and microscopically.
 Thus, it may be useful for understanding human restenosis and for testing therapies aimed at preventing restenosis after balloon angioplasty or other coronary interventional procedures.

"Hydrogen peroxide localization in experimental optic neuritis.
 The association of reactive oxygen species to altered permeability of the blood-brain barrier in acute experimental encephalomyelitis was investigated by ultrastructural cytochemical localization of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to sites in the optic nerve previously identified by extravasation of intravascular horseradish peroxidase.
 Using a modified cerium method, we found electron-dense cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was localized to the perivascular space at the lamina retinalis, lamina choroidalis, and lamina scleralis.
 In the optic nerve head, electron-dense reaction product was observed in the presence of intravascular leukocytes, although adjacent perivascular and interstitial inflammatory cells at this site were scant.
 In the myelinated retrobulbar optic nerve, cerium-derived H2O2 reaction product was seen in the intravascular space of blood vessels and surrounding perivascular and interstitial foci of inflammatory cells.
 Reaction product was also observed in the extracellular space adjacent to the plasmalemma of axons and glial cells in the optic nerve head and retrobulbar nerve.
 The perivascular and intravascular distribution of cerium-derived reaction product suggests that H2O2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of altered vascular permeability in experimental optic neuritis and supports our previous observations of suppression of blood-brain barrier permeability by detoxification of H2O2 with the exogenous administration of antioxidant enzymes.

"Reoperations on heart valve prostheses: an analysis of operative risks and late results.
 To evaluate risks and complications of reoperations on heart valve prostheses, we reviewed data on 183 patients who underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve malfunction.
 The incremental effect of the redo procedure on hospital mortality and morbidity was studied by comparing primary and reoperative procedures and analyzing a series of possible predisposing factors.
 Late survival after first and second reoperations was computed, and possible determinants of late mortality were examined.
 Overall operative mortality was 8.7%; emergency operation (p = 0.0001), previous thromboembolism (p = 0.05), and advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.031) were the independent determinants.
 In a series of 1,355 patients having primary or secondary isolated valve replacement, the redo procedure was a significant risk factor in the univariate analysis (p = 0.025) but not in the multivariate analysis except for the subset of patients having mitral valve replacement (p = 0.052).
 The postoperative course was quite complicated, as evidenced by the long mean stay in the intensive care unit (mean stay, 3.8 days; longer than 2 days for 26% of the survivors).
 Nevertheless, postoperative complications were not significantly greater after a redo procedure than after a primary operation.
 Actuarial survival at 7 years was 57.3% +/- 8%.
 A comparison with a nonhomogeneous series from our institution did not demonstrate significant differences.
 In the subset of 16 patients having a second reoperation, late survival was 37.8% +/- 16% at 2 years.

"Inhibition of hepatic glucose production by SDZ 51641.
 The new oral hypoglycemic agent SDZ 51641 was evaluated in nondiabetic rats and a rat model of human non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Diabetes was induced with a single injection of 37.5 mg/kg streptozocin, and the rats exhibited hyperglycemia in the fed state with normal insulin levels.
 Treatment of nondiabetic animals with 100 mg/kg SDZ 51641 given orally significantly decreased serum glucose and ketone levels within 4 h without affecting insulin levels.
 Nonesterified fatty acids increased more than twofold during the same period.
 Its effect on ketone and fatty acid levels suggests that SDZ 51641 acts as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation.
 Diabetic rats treated with SDZ 51641 exhibited a significant acute hypoglycemic response, which was more pronounced after 3 days of treatment.
 The compound also significantly decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels 27 and 53%, respectively.
 When endogenous hepatic glucose production was assessed in nondiabetic and diabetic animals via continuous infusion of [3-3H]glucose, we found that hepatic glucose production was elevated 43% in diabetic compared with control animals.
 When diabetic rats were treated with 100 mg/kg SDZ 51641, hepatic glucose production decreased to normal levels within 6 h.
 Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies indicated that SDZ 51641 had no effect on insulin-stimulated glucose utilization.
 Measurement of [1-14C]oleate oxidation in isolated hepatocytes demonstrated that SDZ 51641 inhibited long-chain fatty acid oxidation in a concentration-dependent manner.
 The compound was ineffective at inhibiting long-chain fatty acid oxidation in epitrochlearis or soleus muscles.

"Cytokine accumulations in CSF of multiple sclerosis patients: frequent detection of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor but not interleukin-6.
 We identified the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by specific radioimmunoassays in the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases (OND).
 There was a high incidence of detectable IL-1 beta in patients with active MS compared with inactive MS or OND patients.
 TNF was also more frequently present in active MS than in OND CSF.
 By contrast, most MS CSF did not contain detectable IL-6.
 There was no correlation between the degree of CSF pleocytosis and the level of individual cytokines, suggesting that cytokine accumulations may be derived from CNS, and not CSF, cells.
 As IL-1 beta and TNF experimentally induce astrogliosis, demyelination, temperature elevation, lassitude, and sleep, and results raise the possibility that these cytokines may contribute to a variety of manifestations in MS and in other disease states.

"Oncogenes and suppressor genes: their involvement in colon cancer [editorial]
 Abnormalities in oncogenes, which are broadly classified into viral and cellular oncogenes, and suppressor genes appear critical for the development of colon cancer.
 Cellular oncogenes contribute to malignant transformation when they become activated by point mutation, translocation, amplification, or loss of regulator sequences.
 The properties of the oncoproteins, the proteins encoded by oncogenes which are essential for carcinogenesis, are unclear.
 Suppressor genes normally suppress the tumorigenic phenotype by keeping the growth of cells in check; it is their inactivation that contributes to malignant transformation.
 Development of colon cancer appears to take place by stepwise accumulation of multiple genetic alterations during the progression from normal colon to adenoma and carcinoma.
 Activation of ras, an early event in this sequence, is found in 50% of colon cancers; overexpression of c-myc is found in approximately 80%.
 Inactivation of suppressor genes, which occurs during later stages, is noted in greater than 70% of tumors.
 A current model of colonic tumorigenesis is presented.

"Vitreous amyloidosis associated with homozygosity for the transthyretin methionine-30 gene.
 Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder.
 Biochemical studies have revealed that the amyloid protein in familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy of Japanese, Swedish, and Portuguese origin mainly consists of a variant transthyretin with one amino acid substitution of methionine for valine at position 30, termed TTR met-30.
 In five Swedish patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy we diagnosed homozygosity for the TTR met-30 gene using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis.
 The homozygous individuals did not show more severe systemic symptoms or earlier onset than heterozygotes for the TTR met-30 gene.
 The only clinical difference was the presence of vitreous opacities in all homozygous patients.

"Flow cytometric analysis of the mechanism of methylmercury cytotoxicity.
 Flow cytometric analysis of murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) exposed in vitro to 2.5 to 7.5 mumol/l (micromolar) methylmercury (MeHg) reveals a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis (rate of passage through the S phase of the cell cycle), manifested as the accumulation of most of the cells in the S phase, and a modest accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cycle.
 Light microscopy reveals a progressive increase in chromosomal damage (condensation, pulverization).
 At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation.
 Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI).
 In addition, there is a dose-dependent increase in cellular refractive index (90 degrees light scatter), an apparent decrease in cell volume (axial light loss), and progressive resistance to detergent (NP-40)-mediated cytolysis.
 Resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis is indicative of fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, and so on) of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex.
 Our findings indicate that DNA synthesis is the primary target of MeHg cytotoxicity and that apparent targets and degree of cytotoxicity are a complex function of dose.

 Corneal surgeons were surveyed with regard to their technique of suture fixation of posterior chamber intraocular lenses in the absence of posterior capsular support.
 Fifty-nine percent of the 260 respondents stated they perform the procedure almost exclusively during penetrating keratoplasty.
 Scleral fixation was marginally favored over iris fixation by these surgeons.
 Most intraoperative problems reported were related to the relative technical difficulty of the procedure, although transient hemorrhage from the ciliary body was also mentioned.
 Postoperative complications cited included mechanical problems involving the lens and iris, cystoid macular edema, glaucoma, and endophthalmitis.

"Sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe erosive peptic esophagitis resulting from gastroesophageal reflux.
 A total of 36 patients with grade 2 or greater erosive esophagitis and an abnormal 24-h pH monitor study, were treated in a randomized, double-blind fashion to assess the efficacy of sucralfate suspension as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine for severe esophagitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux.
 Treatment consisted of cimetidine, 300 mg qid and either sucralfate suspension (1 g/10 ml) or an identical placebo suspension, 10 ml after meals and 20 ml hs.
 Patients were treated for 12 wk unless endoscopic healing occurred earlier.
 Initial evaluation and monthly follow-up consisted of symptom monitoring, endoscopic evaluation and pre- and post-therapy esophageal manometry, Bernstein test, and 24-h pH monitoring.
 The combination of cimetidine and sucralfate suspension was superior to cimetidine alone in improving daytime heartburn symptoms (p less than 0.05) but not nighttime heartburn, dysphagia, or regurgitation.
 Sucralfate plus cimetidine improved the overall endoscopic outcome of esophagitis more than cimetidine alone (p less than 0.05).
 More patients exhibited endoscopic healing in the adjunctive sucralfate group than in the cimetidine-only group.
 Endoscopic healing, however, was not statistically different between groups.
 We conclude that sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine resulted in improvement of some of the symptoms of reflux, and probably increases the likelihood of complete healing of esophagitis, compared with cimetidine alone.

"Effects of benazepril and metoprolol OROS alone and in combination on myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic stable angina 
 The efficacy of benazepril, metoprolol OROS and their combination was evaluated in 29 patients (42 to 74 years of age) with chronic stable angina and documented coronary artery disease in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial using serial quantitated exercise testing and ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.
 The mean (+/- SEM) exercise time was 8.5 +/- 0.7 min with placebo, 8.3 +/- 0.6 min (95% confidence interval [CI]-1.06 to 0.54) with benazepril, 9.4 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI -0.32 to 2.14) with metoprolol OROS and 9.6 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI -0.25 to 2.47) with the combination of benazepril and metoprolol OROS.
 The mean exercise time to the development of 1 mm ST segment depression was prolonged from 6.0 +/- 0.6 min with placebo to 6.3 +/- 0.6 min (95% CI -0.93 to 1.45) with benazepril, 7.9 +/- 0.5 min (95% CI 0.83 to 3.0) with metoprolol OROS and 8.1 +/- 0.6 min (95% CI 0.88 to 3.29) with the combination of benazepril and metoprolol OROS.
 Benazepril did not alter the rest or maximal heart rate, whereas metoprolol OROS alone and in combination significantly lowered the heart rate at rest and during maximal exercise.
 Systolic blood pressure at rest was nonsignificantly reduced, whereas diastolic blood pressure was lowered significantly by all treatments in comparison with placebo.
 At maximal exercise, only metoprolol OROS, whether given alone or in combination with benazepril, was able to blunt significantly systolic blood pressure and rate-pressure product.

"Myelin autoreactivity in multiple sclerosis: recognition of myelin basic protein in the context of HLA-DR2 products by T lymphocytes of multiple-sclerosis patients and healthy donors.
 A panel of 20 human myelin basic protein (hMBP)-specific T-lymphocyte lines was generated from the peripheral blood of eight multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and two healthy donors, most of them expressing the HLA-DR2 haplotype, which is associated with an increased susceptibility to MS.
 Using HLA-DR gene-transfected mouse L-cell lines as antigen-presenting cells, we established that of the 20 hMBP-specific T-lymphocyte lines, 7 were restricted by the DR2a gene products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype.
 Four T-cell lines recognized hMBP in the context of the DR2b products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype.
 DR2b-restricted T-cell responses were demonstrable only in T-cell lines derived from MS patients.
 The hMBP epitopes presented by the DR2a heterodimer were mapped to peptides covering amino acid residues 1-44, 76-91, 131-145, or 139-153 and to a region spanning the thrombin-cleaved bond at Arg130-Ala131.
 DR2b-restricted T-cell lines recognized epitopes within amino acids 80-99 and 148-162.
 Peptide 139-153 was also presented in the context of HLA-DR1 molecules.
 Our data show that (i) in MS patients both the DR2a and DR2b products of the DR2Dw2 haplotype function as restriction elements for the myelin autoantigen hMBP, (ii) the DR2a molecule presents at least five different epitopes to hMBP-specific T lymphocytes, and (iii) anti-hMBP T-cell lines derived from individual donors can differ in their antigen fine specificity as well as in their HLA restriction.

"Intrathoracic current flow during transthoracic defibrillation in dogs. Transcardiac current fraction.
 To achieve transcardiac threshold current during transthoracic defibrillation, a considerably larger current must be delivered to the thorax to compensate for the shunting effect of the lungs, the thoracic cage, and other elements of the torso.
 This shunting effect is thus an important determinant of transthoracic defibrillation threshold and can be quantified by the transcardiac current fraction (FC, the ratio of transcardiac to transthoracic threshold currents).
 Previous estimates of FC have ranged from as low as 3% to as high as 45%.
 The purpose of of this study was to quantify both FC and the major intrathoracic current pathways.
 Transthoracic and intrathoracic voltages and currents were simultaneously measured during high-voltage transthoracic shocks in 20 dogs.
 With correction factors determined from another set of 12 dogs, these raw data were corrected to compensate for field distortion caused by the presence of the intrathoracic electrodes, and the adjusted data were fit to a resistive network model.
 The results showed that 82% of the transthoracic current was shunted by the thoracic cage, while 14% was shunted by the lungs.
 The remaining 4% (FC) is the portion that passed through the heart.
 There was good agreement between the two independent methods used to calculate FC.
 Analysis based on the model indicated that FC was 3.7%, whereas FC determined by direct measurement with calibrated electrodes was 4.2%.
 Therefore, the results of this study, in contrast to earlier estimates of FC, show that defibrillation in dogs is achieved by only 4% of the total transthoracic current.

"The core polypeptide of cystic fibrosis tracheal mucin contains a tandem repeat structure. Evidence for a common mucin in airway and gastrointestinal tissue.
 A cystic fibrosis trachea cDNA library was constructed and probed with a synthetic oligonucleotide containing a consensus sequence recently identified in human intestinal mucin.
 One of the isolated clones, AMN-22, has been characterized extensively.
 The cDNA sequence of this 884-bp fragment was determined, and revealed a tandem repeat structure rich in threonine and proline residues.
 The repeating sequence of AMN-22 was similar but not identical to that determined for gut mucin.
 When examined by Northern analysis, the mRNA hybridizing to AMN-22 is extremely polydisperse in cystic fibrosis (CF) trachea, with apparent message length varying from approximately 2 kb to greater than 10 kb.
 A similar pattern was observed, with less abundant message, in CF bronchiectatic lung parenchyma.
 The lung cDNA hybridized to a similarly polydisperse message in ulcerative colitis colon RNA, but did not hybridize to control RNA from U937 lymphoma cells or stomach RNA.
 Pedigree analysis of restriction digests of genomic DNA revealed a pattern indicating a single polymorphic locus for the mucin gene expressed in the lung and the intestine.
 Southern analyses of human:mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines allow a chromosomal localization for the mucin gene to human chromosome II, within the region 11p13-11pTer.
 Taken together, these data demonstrate that a polymorphic gene encodes a mucin core polypeptide expressed in both lung and intestine.

 To study the potential utility of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in staging colorectal tumors, 15 resected colonic segments containing 17 elevated lesions were examined on a 1.5- or 1.9-T superconductive MR system.
 The whole intestinal wall was apparent as three or five layers on images obtained with a short repetition time (TR) and short echo time (TE) and as six or eight distinct layers, including the intestinal wall proper as well as an adherent mucus layer and an outer layer of pericolonic fat, on the long TR/TE images.
 In cases of colonic carcinoma, MR images correlated well with the pathologic findings, including the macroscopic growth pattern, depth of mural invasion, and the presence of foci of calcific tumor necrosis and pools of extracellular mucin (colloid).
 These features suggest that MR imaging may be valuable in the clinical evaluation of colorectal tumors.

"Clinical and pathological features of bacillary peliosis hepatis in association with human immunodeficiency virus infection 
 BACKGROUND.
 Peliosis hepatis is characterized by cystic, blood-filled spaces in the liver and is seen in patients with chronic infections or advanced cancer and as a consequence of therapy with anabolic steroids.
 Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; its histologic appearance is that of a pseudoneoplastic vascular proliferation.
 METHODS.
 We studied liver tissue from eight HIV-infected patients with peliosis hepatis, two of whom also had cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis.
 For comparison we examined tissue from four patients who had peliosis hepatis without HIV infection.
 Tissues were examined histologically on routine sections and with special stains and electron microscopy.
 RESULTS.
 The histologic features seen in peliosis hepatis associated with HIV infection, but not in the four cases unrelated to HIV infection, were myxoid stroma and clumps of a granular purple material that on Warthin-Starry staining and electron microscopy proved to be bacilli.
 The bacilli, which could not be cultured, were morphologically identical to those found in the skin lesions of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis.
 The clinical courses of two of the patients with this ""bacillary peliosis hepatis"" indicate that it responds to antibiotic treatment.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 HIV-associated bacillary peliosis hepatis is an unusual, treatable opportunistic infection, probably caused by the same organism that causes cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis.
 Our failure to find bacilli in non-HIV-associated cases implies that other pathogenetic mechanisms may also be responsible for peliosis hepatis.

"Effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation on survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.
 To determine the effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) on the survival of infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, we undertook a retrospective review of 31 infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia treated at Children's National Medical Center.
 Infants were categorized by means of the Bohn quadrant analysis to determine the impact of ECMO on infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia and a ""poor prognosis."" All infants assigned to the Bohn 100% mortality quadrant required ECMO.
 The survival rate in this group was 86% (6/7) when assessed preoperatively and 67% (6/9) when assessed postoperatively.
 Comparison of the change occurring in ventilation index and arterial carbon dioxide pressure demonstrated that after repair the clinical condition of 48% of infants deteriorated, 40% improved, and 12% remained unchanged.
 Of the 12 infants whose condition was worse after surgery, 11 eventually required ECMO.
 Our review demonstrates that ECMO improved survival significantly in infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who had a ""poor prognosis"" by the criteria of Bohn et al.
 We recommend consideration of ECMO for all infants with congenital diaphragmatic hernia for whom maximal medical therapy has failed.

"Antinociceptive interaction between opioids and medetomidine: systemic additivity and spinal synergy.
 The antinociceptive interaction on the tail flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests between opioid analgesics and medetomidine after intravenous (iv) or intrathecal administration were examined by isobolographic analysis.
 Male Sprague-Dawley rats received fixed ratios of medetomidine to morphine, fentanyl, and meperidine of 1:10 and 1:30, 10:1, and 1:3, respectively, by iv administration or 10:1, 3:1 and 10:1, and 1:3 by intrathecal administration, respectively.
 Data were expressed as the percentage maximal possible effect (%MPE).
 The A50 (dose producing 50% MPE) for each drug or drug combination was determined from the dose-response curve.
 Isobolographic analysis revealed that the effect of medetomidine combined with fentanyl, morphine, or meperidine was additive after iv administration.
 The intrathecal administration of combinations of medetomidine with the opioids produced a synergistic antinociceptive effect in the TF but not HP test.
 These data confirmed that the interaction between medetomidine and opioids in producing antinociception may be additive or synergistic, depending on the route of administration, drug ratio administered, and level of processing of the nociceptive input (i.e., spinal vs.
 supraspinal).
 Moreover, these results were consistent with a spinal role for alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating antinociception.
 The authors suggest that the interaction between the opioid and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the spinal cord.

"Surgical epicardial ablation of left ventricular pathway using sling exposure 
 We report our experience with 43 consecutive patients with left free wall pathways operated on since December 1988 using a modified direct epicardial approach through a medial sternotomy, without the adjunct of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.
 The left atrioventricular sulcus is exposed by dislocating the heart cephalad and to the right using a sling made of a large sponge passed around the ventricle through the transverse sinus.
 While the arterial pressure is monitored, the heart is positioned to obtain adequate exposure without compromising the ventricular function.
 The left atrioventricular junction is exposed using a direct approach.
 The epicardium is incised along the ventricular edge and a plane of dissection is identified and opened using blunt dissection over the ventricular wall.
 The entire left atrioventricular junction can be exposed.
 After dissection, electrophysiological testing is repeated to assess accessory pathway conduction.
 Epicardial cryoablation was used when accessory pathway conduction was not present (42 patients).
 Transmural cryoablation was used under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass when accessory pathway conduction persisted after dissection (subendocardial pathway).
 In all, cardiopulmonary bypass was not used in 41 patients.
 There was one early relapse that required transmural cryoablation.

"Role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy for clinical stage B2 prostate cancer.
 To examine the role of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer we reviewed the first 77 such patients in our series since we adopted the nerve-sparing technique.
 A total of 47 patients (61%) underwent bilateral and 26 (34%) underwent unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy, while in 4 (5%) both neurovascular bundles were resected.
 Among the patients followed for 12 months 27 of 41 (66%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 19 (37%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy had potency preserved.
 With the strict clinicopathological criteria of organ-confined tumor, that is intracapsular tumor with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels, complete tumor excision was achieved in 17 patients (36%) treated with bilateral and 7 of 26 (27%) treated with unilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomy.
 All patients in whom both neurovascular bundles were resected had pathological stage C or D1 disease.
 Of the 24 patients who had complete tumor excision by the strict criteria only 15 (19.5% of the 77 preoperatively potent patients) had potency preserved.
 Of these patients 19 had microscopically positive margins without seminal vesicle invasion (pathological stage C1) with undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels.
 In addition, 4 patients had seminal vesicle involvement with negative surgical margins and undetectable postoperative prostate specific antigen levels.
 If these patients also are considered as having complete tumor excision, there was an over-all complete tumor excision rate of 61% (47 of 77), of whom 25 (32% of the 77 patients) had preservation of potency.
 Ten patients with clinical stage B2 tumor whose potency was preserved had histological and serological evidence of incomplete tumor excision.
 Of 53 patients with pathological stage C1 disease 9 (17%) had margins positive only in the regions of the neurovascular bundles.
 Preoperative prostate specific antigen and acid phosphatase levels, and findings on transrectal ultrasonography failed to predict accurately which patients had extracapsular tumor extension.
 Patients with poorly differentiated tumors and/or bulky disease on rectal examination had a higher incidence of extracapsular extension and positive margins.
 We conclude that in the majority of potent patients with clinical stage B2 prostate cancer not all of the goals of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy are realized.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).

"Clinical evaluation of an acetaminophen meter for the rapid diagnosis of acetaminophen intoxication.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To test the accuracy of a newly developed meter that determines serum acetaminophen concentration after a 30-second analysis of one drop of whole blood.
 DESIGN: Sixty-six blood samples from patients with known or suspected drug overdose were analyzed for the presence of acetaminophen.
 In all cases determination of serum acetaminophen concentration was performed simultaneously with the meter and by a reference laboratory.
 SETTING: Eligible patients were those who presented during a nine-month period to the emergency departments of two tertiary care hospitals (including a pediatric hospital).
 RESULTS: Thirty-one specimens had a laboratory-confirmed detectable acetaminophen concentration.
 The meter identified these toxic specimens in all cases; there were no false-negatives (sensitivity, 100%).
 Among the 35 specimens not containing acetaminophen, the meter invariably confirmed a nondetectable serum acetaminophen concentration (specificity, 100%).
 Acetaminophen measurements by the meter correlated strongly with laboratory determinations (r = .985, P less than .001).
 Repeated testing of one specimen documented the precision and reproducibility of the meter's analysis; mean coefficient of variation was .08 in measuring toxic acetaminophen concentrations.
 Drug coingestion had no significant effect on the accuracy of the meter.
 Instrument accuracy was maintained after more than 100 uses without recalibration.
 CONCLUSIONS: This meter identifies the possibility of rapid and accurate determinations of serum acetaminophen concentration.
 The instrument is ideally suited for patients with acetaminophen poisoning in whom expeditious and appropriate administration of antidotal therapy is desired.

 In a randomized 6-month study of 201 patients, the antihypertensive efficiency of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, mepindolol, the beta blocker with intrinsic activity and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared as monitored by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements.
 The study was designed so that a comparable decrease in casual BP values was obtained with all 4 drugs.
 If normotension was not achieved with monotherapy, a diuretic also was administered.
 Pretreatment casual BP and mean 24-hour ambulatory BP values did not differ between the 4 groups.
 Normotension as assessed by casual BP measurements was observed in all 4 groups after 6 months of therapy, there being no significant differences between the groups.
 However, significantly more diuretics were required in the mepindolol (n = 14) and in the enalapril (n = 20) groups compared to the nitrendipine (n = 5) and metoprolol (n = 7) groups.
 Despite comparable casual BP control, the 4 groups differed significantly in their mean 24-hour measurements.
 The greatest systolic and diastolic BP decreases were seen in the metoprolol group.
 Metoprolol was also the most effective drug in decreasing the frequency of systolic pressure peaks greater than 180 mm Hg.
 Both beta blockers and enalapril significantly decreased the morning BP increase compared to the values before treatment, while nitrendipine did not.
 These data show that casual BP measurement is not a good predictor of 24-hour BP in patients taking hypertensive therapy.

"Effects of deep inhalation during early and late asthmatic reactions to allergen [published erratum appears in Am Rev Respir Dis 1991 Feb;143(2):451]
 Eighteen asthmatic patients with a biphasic asthmatic reaction to house dust mite were studied.
 The effect of deep inhalation (DI) was quantitated by comparing the maximal expiratory flow at 40% (MEF40) of vital capacity from partial (P) and maximal (M) flow-volume curves, and specific airway conductance (SGaw) before and after DI (SGawDI).
 At baseline, the ratio MEF40M/P was significantly larger than unity (1.45 +/- 0.26 SD), whereas the ratio SGawDI/SGaw was not significantly different from unity (0.92 +/- 0.24).
 During early phase reaction, both MEF40M/P and SGawDI/SGaw were significantly increased to 2.66 +/- 0.97 and 1.96 +/- 0.47, respectively.
 During late phase reaction, when the FEV1 values were similar to those observed during early phase reaction, MEF40M/P and SGawDI/SGaw were 1.86 +/- 0.46 and 1.43 +/- 0.29, respectively, significantly higher than the values at baseline but significantly lower than those during early phase reaction.
 Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of nine patients when SGaw values during the late phase reaction were similar to those during the early phase reaction.
 We conclude that DI has a different effect during early and late asthmatic reactions, suggesting a different ratio of airway to parenchymal hysteresis.
 This may result from an increased parenchymal hysteresis (more peripherally located bronchial obstruction) or a decreased airway hysteresis (prominent airway inflammation) during the late phase reaction.

"Survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: recommendations for uniform definitions and data to report.
 Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest vary widely among locations.
 We surveyed the definitions used in published studies of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
 Data from 74 studies involving 36 communities showed survival rates ranging from 2% to 44%.
 There were five different case definitions and 11 different definitions of survivors.
 The absence of uniform definitions prevents meaningful intersystem comparisons, prohibits explorations of hypotheses about effective interventions, and interferes with the efforts of quality assurance.
 The most satisfactory numerator for a survival rate appears to be survival to hospital discharge; the most appropriate denominator appears to be witnessed adult cardiac arrest of presumed heart disease etiology, with ventricular fibrillation as the initial identified rhythm.
 Proposed definitions for the data emergency medical services systems should report as they examine their cardiac arrest survival rates are presented.

"The association of blood pressure levels and change in renal function in hypertensive and nonhypertensive subjects.
 We compared the changes in serum creatinine levels over time after a mean follow-up of 9.8 years in essential hypertensive (EH, n = 56) and control (n = 59) male veteran subjects.
 All subjects had normal serum creatinine levels (62 to 124 mumol/L) and ""normal"" urinalysis results on entry into the study.
 Subjects with comorbid renal diagnoses and diabetes mellitus were eliminated from the analysis.
 Although not statistically significant, the rate of change in the serum creatinine concentration over time was greater in the EH cohort compared with the control cohort (1.08 +/- 4.8 vs 0.027 +/- 3.5 mumol/L per year).
 The difference was especially marked in black EH subjects vs black control subjects (1.60 +/- 6.2 mumol/L per year vs -0.21 +/- 3.3 mumol/L per year).
 When age, race, body mass index, and a diagnosis of EH were entered into a logistic regression analysis, EH subjects had a statistically significantly greater rate of decline in renal function than did control subjects (1.5 +/- 8.3 mumol/L per year).
 When mean time-averaged systolic blood pressure for each subject was also included in the logistic regression analysis, only systolic time-averaged blood pressure was statistically significant (0.063 +/- 0.029 mumol/L per year).
 We conclude that in the absence of clinically detected parenchymal renal disease, EH subjects have a greater rate of decline in renal function than do nonhypertensive subjects.
 Time-averaged blood pressure is predictive of the change in serum creatinine concentration not only in EH subjects but also in nonhypertensive subjects.
 Thus, preservation of renal function may require a blood pressure lower than the currently accepted normotensive range.

"Management of stage D1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate: the Johns Hopkins experience 1974 to 1987.
 There is no consensus on the proper management of men with stage D1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
 Although cure is unlikely, many men survive for long intervals apparently free of metastatic disease.
 Thus, effective palliation of the local lesion with low morbidity is desirable.
 From 1974 to 1987, 120 consecutive men with stage D1 prostate cancer were treated with 3 primary modes of therapy (mean followup 48 months): 1) expectant therapy (35), 2) external beam radiotherapy (21) and 3) radical prostatectomy (64).
 These patients were statistically homogeneous as determined by Gleason grade but not by extent of metastatic disease.
 The over-all 5 and 10-year projected actuarial survival rates for the radical prostatectomy patients were 97 and 62%, respectively, and the apparent clinical survival free of disease at 5 years and 80 months, respectively, was 83 and 68%.
 The direct disease-specific 10-year survival free of disease was 46%.
 However, only 3 of 27 patients followed for 3 years or longer had undetectable levels of prostate specific antigen.
 Using a Cox univariate proportional hazards model several factors appeared to have significant prognostic value including volume of lymph node metastases (macroscopic greater than 2 mm.), percentage of positive lymph nodes sampled and frozen section diagnosis.
 Gleason grade, clinical stage and the number of positive nodes did not have significant prognostic value.
 Local recurrence requiring an operation was noted in 8 of 35 patients (23%) treated expectantly, 5 of 21 (24%) treated with radiotherapy and 2 of 64 (3%) treated with radical prostatectomy.
 Significant gastrointestinal or genitourinary complications occurred in 33% of the men treated with radiotherapy and 1.5% of those undergoing radical prostatectomy.
 Since the introduction of nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy in 1982, potency resumed in 55% of the 33 patients who were potent preoperatively and have been followed 1 year or longer.
 These data suggest that in properly selected patients radical prostatectomy, although not curative, can provide excellent palliation of the local lesion with acceptable morbidity and that symptomatic local recurrence of prostatic cancer achieved with radiation therapy is identical to the results in men who were managed expectantly.

"Combined modality therapy for locally advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.
 Multi-modality treatment consisting of cisplatin, VP-16, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy given concomitantly with external beam radiation was used to treat 64 patients with locally advanced Stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma.
 This regimen was used in a preoperative fashion for four cycles in patients considered surgically resectable and with curative intent for six cycles in the remainder of patients.
 The clinical response rate for the entire group was 84% and the overall local control rate was 74%.
 The median survival was 13 months with a median follow-up for live patients of 19 months.
 The actuarial 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates were 30% and 23%, respectively.
 Histologic complete response was 39% and appeared to predict for survival.
 The 3-year actuarial survival and disease-free survival rates for 23 resected patients were 69% and 45%, respectively, with the complete histologic responders having a disease-free survival of 78%.
 The pattern of first recurrence did not appear to differ by histology or presence of lymph nodes in this subset of patients.

"Monitoring enzyme replacement treatment in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency using the cholesteryl octanoate breath test.
 The cholesteryl-14C-octanoate breath test was used to monitor the intraluminal enzymatic activity of pancreatin preparations in six patients with severe pancreatic insufficiency.
 Conventional enzyme replacement, with cimetidine as an adjunct, was compared to supplementation with enteric coated microspheres.
 In healthy control subjects, 14CO2 excretion rose rapidly and peaked at 90-120 minutes; mean (SD) cumulative recovery at four hours was 51 (8)%.
 In patients with pancreatic insufficiency on no treatment mean (SD) cumulative recovery was only 6 (4)%.
 After pancreatin, with previous administration of cimetidine, it increased to 27 (11)% with a time course resembling that in controls.
 With 2 mm enteric coated microspheres, 14CO2 excretion did not rise significantly before 120 minutes and cumulative recovery after four hours was 15 (11)%.
 In a control study, 2 mm radio-opaque microspheres did not empty from the stomach until two hours after ingestion.
 The results suggest that the cholesteryl octanoate breath test can be successfully used to monitor the intraluminal enzymatic activity after treatment with different forms of enzyme replacement in pancreatic insufficiency.
 In contrast to treatment with conventional pancreatin and cimetidine as an adjunct, 2 mm enteric coated microspheres did not show in vivo enzymatic activity until two hours after administration.

"Aggressive evaluation for atypical squamous cells in Papanicolaou smears.
 A retrospective study was done on women who had atypical Papanicolaou smears and were referred for immediate colposcopy.
 The smears were obtained during January 1985 to March 1989 at Edwards Air Force Base, California.
 Excluded from the evaluation were abnormal Papanicolaou smears with hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and koilocytotic atypia suggestive of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
 The evaluation included colposcopy, colposcopically directed biopsies, endocervical curettage and repeat Papanicolaou smears.
 A total of 101 patients were included in the study.
 Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was seen in 29.7% (30 patients): 12.9% (13) CIN I, 12.9% (13) CIN II and 3.9% (4) CIN III.
 Carcinoma was seen in 3.9% (4) of the patients: 2.9% (3) was carcinoma in situ, and 0.99% (1) was invasive squamous cell carcinoma, stage IIb.
 HPV and dysplastic lesions were seen together in 19.8% (20) of the patients.
 HPV was seen alone in 45% (46).
 Twenty-one patients (20.8%) had no apparent lesions on colposcopy, although one developed microinvasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma within 36 months of colposcopy.
 Many significant lesions can go undetected for extended periods of time in women with atypical Papanicolaou smears, resulting in delayed management.

"Rheologic properties of mixed hemoglobin gels: deoxyhemoglobins S and F.
 To obtain new information concerning the behaviors--and in turn, the structures--of gels formed from mixtures of S and F hemoglobins, their rheologic properties have been characterized by stress relaxation.
 The variables manipulated were (1) initial total hemoglobin concentration; (2) mole fraction of hemoglobin S present in the mixture; (3) hemoglobin F as only intact tetramer or as both tetramers and hybridized hemoglobin; (4) hemoglobin F as predominantly G gamma, A gamma, or a mixture of gamma chain types; (5) annealing time; (6) shear history, (7) temperature; and (8) temperature and time of annealing.
 Characteristics monitored to gain information about the effect of these variables on gel properties were (1) lag time, (2) polymer mass, (3) polymer fraction, (4) polymer composition, (5) equilibrium total hemoglobin activity, and (6) solidity/total or hemoglobin S polymer mass (or total or hemoglobin S fraction).
 As expected, mixed hemoglobin S and F gels were less solid than pure hemoglobin S gels of similar initial total hemoglobin concentrations because of lower polymer mass, and gel properties were influenced by annealing time, shear history, temperature, and temperature and time of annealing.
 However, when solidities were compared on the basis of similar quantities of gel present, mixed hemoglobin S and F gels were found to be more solid than those of pure S as the mole fraction of hemoglobin S decreased in the initial mixture.
 This is explained by the predominant influence on gel properties of high hemoglobin activity incurred by the volume exclusion effect of the total hemoglobin concentration.
 Pathophysiologic implications of these findings for various sickle cell disorders are proposed.

"National survey of the pattern of care for carcinoma of the lung.
 A national survey of the patterns of care for carcinoma of the lung sponsored by the Commission on Cancer of the American College of Surgeons has documented continuing changes in epidemiology, treatment, and outcome.
 The project consisted of a long-term study of 15,219 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1981 and a short-term study of 19,074 patients whose diagnosis was made in 1986.
 The male/female incidence ratios have continued to decrease and the decrease has moved into the older age groups.
 Although the percentage of adenocarcinoma is increasing at the expense of squamous carcinoma, the latter is still the most prevalent histologic type.
 The accuracy of percutaneous needle biopsy and transbronchial biopsy of lung nodules reported from this group of 941 hospitals was high and equal to that reported by single institutions.
 The percentage of patients having a resection did not increase from 1981 to 1986, but for smaller lesions a move was apparent toward more lung-sparing resections.
 Little change has occurred in the use of adjuvant radiotherapy, particularly in stage III disease, where approximately 50% of the patients received postoperative irradiation.
 An improvement in the overall 5-year survival when compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data was noted.
 Whether this is a true improvement in survival or is the result of selection because of an unrecognized change in the pattern of care for patients with a carcinoma of the lung is unknown.

 The postoperative courses of 39 patients with severe lung disease (31 with obstructive disease and 8 restrictive) who underwent a cardiac operation were retrospectively reviewed.
 The stay in the intensive care unit of the study group was 7.9 +/- 10.3 days (mean +/- standard deviation) compared with 2.4 +/- 3.9 days for the control group (100 patients with less impaired pulmonary function) (p less than 0.001).
 The study group also had a greater number of valve replacements than did the control group (p less than 0.01).
 Patients with obstructive disease had more respiratory complications than did patients with restrictive disease (p less than 0.05).
 There were 21 cases of atelectasis.
 Effusions were noted in 11 patients.
 Ten patients had bronchospasm.
 Bronchial secretions were a major problem in 6 patients.
 Pneumonia developed in 4 patients, and pneumothorax occurred in 3 others.
 The two in-hospital deaths were not directly related to pulmonary complications.
 Our findings indicate that (1) patients with severe lung impairment generally do well after a cardiac operation but have more postoperative pulmonary complications than patients with less impairment; (2) patients with restrictive pulmonary disease appear to fare better than those with obstructive disease; (3) pulmonary function tests can alert the clinician to the possible risk of postoperative complications, but they cannot, by themselves, be used to exclude patients from operation; and (4) patients with severe pulmonary impairment facing valve replacement are at greater risk of pulmonary complications than patients having other types of cardiac surgical intervention.

"Free radical inhibition and serial chemiluminescence in evolving experimental pancreatitis.
 Oxygen free radical activity and inhibition were examined in experimental pancreatitis.
 Twenty-five rats were randomized to five groups: controls received intravenous saline, to simulate pancreatitis one group received intravenous caerulein (5 micrograms kg-1 h-1), and three groups received sodium taurocholate via the pancreatic duct (0.2 ml, 5 per cent), either alone, following allopurinol or immediately before superoxide dismutase.
 Chemiluminescence (a phenomenon based on the emission of light during chemical reactions and which is dependent on oxygen free radical activity) was used as an index of oxygen free radical activity and was measured in tissue samples at 5-min intervals following induction of pancreatitis.
 The control mean(s.e.m.) serum amylase level 1 h after induction of pancreatitis was 635(13) units.
 It was significantly elevated in caerulein-induced pancreatitis, 1833(118) units (P less than 0.05) and exceeded 3000 units in all taurocholate-infused animals.
 Mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence ranged from 44 (8) mV 100 mg-1 at time zero to 404(113) mV 100 mg-1 at 1 h in controls.
 In caerulein-induced pancreatitis mean(s.e.m.) chemiluminescence peaked at 20 min (1399(239) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.02) and in taurocholate-induced pancreatitis at 15 min (2316(95) mV 100 mg-1, P less than 0.004).

"Pelvic inflammatory disease.
 The costs of PID to both individuals and society are enormous.
 Although primary prevention of PID through control of lower genital tract infections is the most effective prevention strategy, early diagnosis and treatment of acute PID may minimize some of its serious sequelae.
 Although laparoscopy is helpful for establishing the diagnosis of salpingitis, other less invasive tests along with selected clinical criteria may also be useful.
 Treatment of PID, which is empiric and broad spectrum, is oriented toward polymicrobial PID.
 Whenever possible, women with PID should be hospitalized for parenteral therapy.
 The 1989 CDC STD treatment guidelines recommend two regimens for inpatient parenteral therapy: clindamycin/gentamicin and cefoxitin, or equivalent cephalosporin/doxycycline.
 Outpatient management of PID should be monitored closely; the CDC-recommended regimen includes use of intramuscular cephalosporins and oral doxycycline.

 The influence of the trigeminal nerve on the cerebral circulation was investigated in chronically denervated cats during and after reversible four-vessel occlusion for 10 minutes combined with controlled hypotension (50 mm Hg).
 Postocclusive hyperemia 30 minutes after reperfusion was attenuated by up to 48% in cortical gray matter of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral artery territories on the side of trigeminal ganglionectomy.
 Similar results were observed for denervation accomplished by direct surgical ablation and by the topical application of capsaicin to a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery.
 Denervation did not alter basal cerebral blood flow or the duration of hyperemia, nor did it impair the cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia.
 These data demonstrate the importance of neurogenic mechanisms in the development of postischemic hyperperfusion and suggest that strategies directed at blocking axon reflex-like mechanisms may be beneficial in reducing the morbidity that follows severe cortical hyperemia.

"Impact of a public cholesterol screening program.
 The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has endorsed physician case finding as the primary method to detect individuals with elevated cholesterol levels.
 Despite this recommendation, promotional and for-profit public screening programs have flourished.
 We surveyed participants of a mall-based cholesterol screening program 1 year after their screening.
 Sixty-four percent of those screened had not previously known their cholesterol levels.
 Those who were newly screened were less likely to benefit from this testing than the general public, since they were older (mean age, 55.3 years), more likely to be female (67.4%), and nonsmokers (88%).
 Screenees had excellent recall of their cholesterol level (mean absolute reporting error, 0.24 mmol/L [9 mg/dL]) and a good understanding of cholesterol as a coronary heart disease risk.
 Those with elevated cholesterol levels reported high distress from screening but no reduction in overall psychosocial well-being and an actual decrease in absenteeism.
 Only 53.7% of all who were advised to seek follow-up because of an elevated screening value had done so within the year following the screening program.
 However, of those with values greater than 6.2 mmol/L (240 mg/dL), 68% had sought follow-up.
 Many of those who participate in public screening programs have been previously tested, fall into low-benefit groups, or fail to comply with recommended follow-up.
 We therefore conclude that cholesterol screening programs of the type now commonly offered are unlikely to contribute greatly to the national efforts to further reduce coronary heart disease.

 Bipolar radiofrequency electrocoagulation of the cystic duct by catheter can be performed safely and reproducibly using fluoroscopic control and induces endoluminal scar formation.
 The scar within the cystic duct forms a reliable barrier between the gallbladder and the biliary system and avoids recanalization of the cystic duct at a later date.
 Sclerotherapy of the isolated gallbladder with 95% ethanol and 3% STS can be performed without toxic or otherwise adverse effects and is suitable to ablate the porcine gallbladder.

"Impact of intrauterine growth retardation and body proportionality on fetal and neonatal outcome.
 Previous prognostic studies of infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) have not adequately considered the heterogeneity of IUGR in terms of cause, severity, and body proportionality and have been prone to misclassification of IUGR because of errors in estimation of gestational age.
 Based on a cohort of 8719 infants with early-ultrasound-validated gestational ages and indexes of body proportionality standardized for birth weight, the consequences of severity and cause-specific IUGR and proportionality for fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality were assessed.
 With progressive severity of IUGR, there were significant (all P less than .001) linear trends for increasing risks of stillbirth, fetal distress (abnormal electronic fetal heart tracings)O during parturition, neonatal hypoglycemia (minimum plasma glucose less than 40 mg/dL), hypocalcemia (minimum Ca less than 7 mg/dL), polycythemia (maximum capillary hemoglobin greater than or equal to 21 g/dL), severe depression at birth (manual ventilation greater than 3 minutes), 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores less than or equal to 6, 1-minute Apgar score less than or equal to 3, and in-hospital death.
 These trends persisted for the more common outcomes even after restriction to term (37 to 42 weeks) births.
 There was no convincing evidence that outcome among infants with a given degree of growth retardation varied as a function of cause of that growth retardation.
 Among infants with IUGR, increased length-for-weight had significant crude associations with hypoglycemia and polycythemia, but these associations disappeared after adjustment for severity of growth retardation and gestational age.

"Long-term potentiation of electrotonic coupling at mixed synapses.
 Long-term potentiation of chemical synapses is closely related to memory and learning.
 Studies of this process have concentrated on chemically mediated excitatory synapses.
 By contrast, activity-dependent modification of gap junctions, which also widely exist in higher structures such as hippocampus and neocortex, has not been described.
 Here we report that at mixed synapses between sensory afferents and an identified reticulospinal neuron, the electrotonic coupling potential can be potentiated, as well as the chemically mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, for a prolonged time period using a stimulation paradigm like that which produces long-term potentiation in hippocampus.
 The effect on coupling is due to an increase in gap-junctional conductance.
 Our data indicate that the potentiation of both synaptic components requires an increase in intracellular calcium, involves activation of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, and is specific to the tetanized pathway.

 Other channel properties, such as mean open times, single channel conductance, ion selectivity, and behavior in the presence of pharmacological agents, were similar among myotube types.
 Compared to the Ca2+ concentrations in normal human and normal mouse myotubes, intracellular resting free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in myotubes of Duchenne and mdx origin were significantly higher at a time when dystrophin is first expressed in normal tissue.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased open probability of Ca2+ leak channels contributes to the elevated free intracellular Ca2+ concentration in Duchenne human and mdx mouse myotubes.

"Differential regulation of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs): a specific regulatory element in HIV-2 responds to stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor.
 The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) types 1 and 2 have similar genetic organization but differ significantly in nucleic acid sequence.
 Although infection by either agent leads to symptoms of immunodeficiency, recent studies suggest potential differences in the time course and severity of these diseases.
 In this report, the transcriptional regulation and induction of these retroviruses were analyzed.
 We report that the regulation of HIV-2 differs from that of HIV-1: a distinct T-cell activation pathway, triggering of the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex, stimulates HIV-2 but not HIV-1 gene expression.
 The response to T-cell receptor stimulation in HIV-2 is mediated partly by an upstream regulatory element, termed CD3R, which is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, NF-CD3R.
 Jurkat T leukemia cell lines containing HIV-2 provirus also showed increased viral replication after stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex, in contrast to HIV-1.
 These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation and induction of HIV-2 differ from HIV-1 and raise the possibility that different cofactors contribute to the activation of HIV-1- and HIV-2-associated AIDS.

 A case of bronchial carcinoid tumor with foci of extramedullary hematopoiesis is presented.
 The patient had a 6-year history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia and hepatosplenomegaly.
 All three hematopoietic cell lines were represented in different areas of the bronchial tumor.

"The relative value of conventional staging procedures for developing prognostic models in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer.
 Published prognostic models for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have either combined limited- and extensive-stage patients or have not included standard anatomic staging information to assess the relative value of the knowledge of specific sites and number of sites of metastases in predicting survival in extensive-stage disease.
 We studied 136 extensive-stage patients in whom traditional staging procedures were performed and in whom other previously demonstrated significant pretreatment variables were determined.
 Using the Cox proportional hazards model, when all data were included, three variables were significant: performance status (PS) (P = .0001), number of sites of metastases (P = .0010), and age (P = .0029).
 A prognostic algorithm was developed using these variables, which divided the patients into three distinct groups.
 When the anatomic staging data were omitted, the serum albumin (P = .0313) was the only variable in addition to PS (P = .0001) and age (P = .0064) that was significant.
 An alternative algorithm using these three variables was nearly as predictive as the original.
 Therefore, in extensive-stage patients, reasonable pretreatment prognostic information can be obtained without using the number or specific sites of metastases as variables once the presence of distant metastases has been demonstrated.

"In vitro evaluation of nicotinamide riboside analogs against Haemophilus influenzae.
 Exogenous NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside is required for the growth of Haemophilus influenzae.
 These compounds have been defined as the V-factor growth requirement.
 We have previously shown that the internalization of nicotinamide riboside is energy dependent and carrier mediated with saturation kinetics.
 Thionicotinamide riboside, 3-pyridinealdehyde riboside, 3-acetylpyridine riboside, and 3-aminopyridine riboside were prepared from their corresponding NAD analogs.
 These compounds and several other nicotinamide riboside analogs were evaluated for their ability to support the growth of H.
 influenzae and for their ability to block the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside by H.
 influenzae.
 3-Aminopyridine riboside blocked the uptake of [carbonyl-14C]nicotinamide riboside and inhibited the growth of H.
 influenzae when NAD, nicotinamide mononucleotide, or nicotinamide riboside served as the V factor.
 The antibacterial activity of 3-aminopyridine riboside was found to be specific for H.
 influenzae but had no effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus or Escherichia coli.
 In additional experiments by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, it was determined that whole cells of H.
 influenzae degrade 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide to 3-aminopyridine riboside, which is then internalized.
 Inside the cell, 3-aminopyridine riboside has the ability to interfere with the growth of H.

"Vision screening in a primary care setting. A missed opportunity?
 To determine the effectiveness of vision screening in a primary care setting, we administered a questionnaire and a vision test to 458 patients from a general medical clinic.
 Subjects were referred for complete ophthalmologic evaluation if they failed the vision test or met other ""high-risk"" criteria based on information contained in the questionnaire.
 Patient-initiated requests for eye examinations were also honored.
 A total of 169 patients were scheduled for eye examinations, and 148 actually underwent ophthalmologic evaluation.
 One hundred one of those examined were referred on the basis of the study criteria.
 ""Serious eye disease"" (cataract, glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular degeneration) was diagnosed in 96 (95%) of these patients.
 Prompt surgical intervention was recommended in 27 (27%), and medical treatment was begun in 21 (21%).
 Of those with serious eye disease, 59% met the criteria by failing the vision test, while 69% met the high-risk criteria determined by the questionnaire.
 Of the 148 subjects who received ophthalmologic evaluations, 47 requested them.
 Serious eye disease was diagnosed in 23 (50%) of the 47 patients.
 None of these individuals required immediate surgery, and medical treatment for glaucoma was begun in eight (17%).
 These data suggest that screening for serious eye disease in a primary care setting is an efficient mechanism to use for the identification of patients with undetected ocular disorders that require follow-up or treatment.

"Recurrence of resected esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: results of re-resection.
 Isolated local recurrence following potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction does not necessarily imply pending systemic disease and early demise.
 While radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy is standard treatment for such patients, resection is another available option.
 Resection may also be a consideration should localized disease persist after non-operative therapy in the absence of metastases.
 A 5 year retrospective review was performed examining 204 resections performed prior to 1989.
 Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period.
 No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected.
 One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence.
 Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients.
 Although there were no postoperative deaths, major complications occurred in 4 patients.

"FcR-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection by antibody.
 Although CD4 is a major receptor for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of cells, studied by ourselves and others clearly show that the Fc receptor (FcR) also plays a role in infection, perhaps in conjunction with other surface receptors.
 IgG antibodies to HIV-1 will enhance infectivity in cells (such as monocyte-macrophages) that have surface Fc receptors; F(ab')2 fragments of antibodies did not enhance, and blocking of FcR inhibited enhancement.
 The high-affinity FcR for IgG (Fc gamma RI) appeared to be functional.
 Sera from HIV-1-infected patients had neutralizing activity at high concentrations, but enhanced infection at low concentrations (i.e., high dilutions).
 Our studies show that the CD4 receptor is required for antibody-mediated enhancement of infection, as enhancement can be blocked by recombinant soluble CD4 and by Leu3 antibody.
 Although enhancement can be demonstrated in vitro, the in vivo importance of enhancing antibodies remains to be defined in HIV-1 infection.

"Human papillomavirus infections of the genital tract.
 Infection of the genital tract by HPV is a sexually transmitted disease of increasing prevalence.
 The association of HPV infection with genital tract malignancies is of great concern, and further studies are needed to clarify this association.
 Few investigators believe at this time that proof of a direct causative role exists for HPV in these cancers, but indirect evidence of such a role is abundant.
 There are many clinical forms of HPV infection of the genital tract, and few clinicians can easily recognize them all.
 Treatment of condyloma acuminatum is difficult and frustrating.
 Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the safest and most effective therapy for most forms of condyloma acuminatum.
 Recurrence of condyloma acuminatum is common with all presently used forms of therapy, probably owing to latent HPV infection in normal-appearing skin.
 No form of treatment is ideal for all forms of condyloma acuminatum, but without continued efforts to find better therapeutic modalities and preventative measures, the epidemic of genital HPV infection will continue unchecked.

 We performed a prospective controlled study of apneic oxygenation on 15 patients undergoing apnea tests for brain death.
 All patients were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen at existing respirator settings.
 During the 10-minute apnea tests, nine patients were given continuous apneic oxygenation by tracheal cannula.
 The other six patients had tracheal tubes open to room air.
 The patients given apneic oxygenation had little or no hypoxia by the end of the test.
 The patients given room air during the test became hypoxic.
 Many neurologists perform apnea tests with no oxygenation or with preoxygenation alone.

"The management of aneurysms and arterio-venous fistulae of the popliteal artery arising from war trauma. Emphasis on sigmoid operative approach.
 Between 1986-1988, 600 vascular cases arising from the Iran-Iraq conflict were dealt with within an 18 month period and 60 cases of popliteal artery and/or venous disruption were encountered presenting at variable times after injury.
 A policy of management between the forward and base hospital surgical teams was introduced, observing the following broad categorizations: (a) assessment/referral, (b) assessment/fasciotomy/referral, (c) immediate operation/referral for further operation/review/management.
 Two types of incision were used to enter the popliteal fossa: (a) a medial incision and (b) a sigmoid posterior incision (which we now favor).
 The results of this strategy of management and operative technique (when compared with our previous experience within the same time frame) suggested an improved outcome.
 Fifty-four out of 60 cases had a satisfactory operative result with below-knee amputation being required in only four cases and higher amputations in two others.
 No operative or postoperative deaths occurred.
 The implementation of this ""vetting policy"" at the front line appeared to reduce the number of amputations and assisted the clarification of management criteria in assessing limb viability at the forward hospital when a large number of casualties were being received.
 Operative access using the sigmoid posterior incision was not associated with any complications, offered better exposure than the medial incision and was technically easier for the surgeon to perform.

"Morphological and biochemical changes in gastric mucosa of aging rats.
 Although previous data from this laboratory have indicated that aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, no direct assessment of proliferative potential of the tissue has been made during aging.
 In order to assess this, and to determine whether changes in mucosal proliferative potential would be reflected in growth of the tissue, we have examined the labeling index (LI), height and morphology of the gastric mucosa in young (4-month-old) and aged (24-month-old) Fischer-344 rats.
 In addition, tyrosine kinase (Tyr-k) activity and the levels of phosphotyrosine proteins were determined to evaluate their relationship to mucosal proliferative activity.
 Histologic evaluation revealed a marked atrophy of the mucosal glandular component with 32% reduction in height in aged rats when compared with young animals.
 In aged rats, there was also a decrease in gland density, resulting in a reduction in the number of epithelial cells of all types with evidence of decreased secretory activity.
 Despite the occurrence of mucosal atrophy in aged rats, LI in these animals was significantly increased by 28%.
 This was associated with a parallel rise in mucosal Tyr-k activity, and a two- to threefold increase in the relative concentrations of seven phosphotyrosine membrane proteins with Mr of 120, 105, 90, 60, 55, 48 and 32 kDa.
 We conclude that (1) although aging is associated with increased gastric mucosal proliferative activity, this does not result in mucosal growth and that (2) Tyr-k and tyrosine phosphorylation of certain proteins play a role in the regulation of gastric mucosal cell proliferation during aging.

 Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias are reported in up to 40% of patients early after coronary artery bypass graft operations.
 In a randomized study, we compared the efficacy and safety of the class III antiarrhythmic beta-blocking drug sotalol versus propranolol at low and high doses in the prevention of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in 429 consecutive patients after coronary artery bypass graft operations.
 Patients with severely depressed left ventricular function and other contraindications for beta-blockers were excluded.
 From the fourth hour up to the sixth day after coronary artery bypass, 74 patients received low-dose sotalol (40 mg every 8 hours), 66 patients low-dose propranolol (10 mg every 6 hours), 133 patients high-dose sotalol (80 mg every 8 hours), and 156 patients high-dose propranolol (20 mg every 6 hours).
 Baseline characteristics were comparable in all groups.
 Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia was observed in 10 of 72 (13.9%) who received low-dose sotalol, 12 of 64 (18.8%) who received low-dose propranolol, 13 of 119 (10.9%) who received high-dose sotalol, and 19 of 139 (13.7%) who received high-dose propranolol (not significant).
 Drug-related adverse effects necessitating discontinuation of the drug occurred in four receiving low doses (2.9%) and in 31 receiving high doses (10.7%) (p less than 0.02).
 In conclusion, no medication was found to be superior, although supraventricular tachyarrhythmias tended to be less prevalent in patients treated with sotalol than in those treated with propranolol.
 Moreover, significantly fewer adverse effects were noted in both low-dose groups.
 Therefore, low-dose beta-blocking treatment, especially low-dose sotalol, seems preferable.

 The prevalence of pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux in children and adolescents with asthma was studied by 24 hour two level oesophageal pH monitoring in 42 subjects aged 9-20 years with moderate or severe bronchial asthma.
 The importance of oesophagobronchial nerve reflexes and of aspiration of gastric acid as triggers in asthma was assessed by studying whether episodes of reflux into the distal and into the proximal oesophagus were followed by asthma attacks.
 Twenty-one subjects (50%) had a pathological total reflux time in the distal oesophagus and six (16%) in the proximal oesophagus.
 Nine patients had pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux into the distal oesophagus together with symptoms of asthma during the day on which the recording took place.
 In three of them the episodes of asthma symptoms were significantly correlated with preceding episodes of reflux into the distal oesophagus, and in one subject to reflux into the proximal oesophagus.
 We conclude that pathological gastro-oesophageal reflux is common in children and adolescents with asthma, but it seems to provoke symptoms of asthma in only a few.
 Symptoms of asthma were more often elicited by exposure of the distal oesophagus to gastric acid, possibly by a vagal reflex, than by aspiration of gastric juice.

"Effect of blood transfusion on oxygen consumption in pediatric septic shock.
 Treatment plans for pediatric septic shock advocate increasing oxygen consumption (VO2).
 Recent studies in septic shock indicate that improving oxygen delivery (DO2) by increasing blood flow will increase VO2.
 We prospectively examined the effect on VO2 of improving DO2 by increasing oxygen content (CO2) with blood transfusion in eight hemodynamically stable septic shock patients.
 Transfusion consisted of 8 to 10 ml/kg of packed RBC over 1 to 2 h.
 Hemodynamic and oxygen transport measurements were obtained before and after blood transfusion.

"Growth factor-dependent differentiation along the myeloid and lymphoid lineages in an immature acute T lymphocytic leukemia.
 Bone marrow cells from a child with an immature (CD2+, CD5+, CD7+) acute T lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) were cultured in the presence and absence of human rIL-2, IL-3, or granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF.
 Cells cultured without growth factors failed to divide and those initiated in the presence of IL-2 or GM-CSF underwent maturation and terminal T lymphoid or myelomonocytic differentiation, respectively.
 In contrast, a permanent growth factor-dependent cell line, designated TALL-103/3, was established upon culture in IL-3.
 The TALL-103/3 cells gradually lost the T cell-specific markers and acquired a myeloid phenotype (CD15+, CD33+).
 Switching of the IL-3-dependent cells at an early passage to medium containing only human rIL-2 resulted in the establishment of a subline, named TALL-103/2, with a T lymphoid phenotype (CD3+, CD8+, TCR-gamma delta +, CD7+).
 The TALL-103/2 cells strictly require IL-2 for growth, are irreversibly committed to the lymphoid lineage, and cannot survive in the presence of any other hemopoietic growth factor tested so far.
 In contrast, the IL-3-dependent TALL-103/3 cells could be adapted to grow in synthetic (serum-free) medium also in the presence of either GM-CSF or IL-5, in which they retain a myeloid phenotype.
 Interestingly, after 18 mo in culture in IL-3, the TALL-103/3 cells can still be phenotypically converted to the lymphoid lineage upon addition of IL-2, thus maintaining its bipotentiality.
 Despite the marked phenotypic differences, the TALL-103/2 and TALL-103/3 cell lines show the same karyotypes with multiple abnormalities present in the primary malignant clone and have identical rearrangements of the TCR-gamma and -delta loci, thus confirming their derivation from a common precursor cell.
 Together, these findings indicate that the phenotype of immature T-ALL cells can be drastically modified by the presence of specific hemopoietic growth factors in the environment, leading to either lymphoid or myeloid lineage commitment while leaving their karyotype and genotype intact.

"Interleukin-2 immunotherapy in children.
 Immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2 possesses great potential in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and cancers.
 However, only a few reports on a small number of children have appeared in the literature.
 From March 1988 to March 1989, 11 children and adolescents were treated with IL-2.
 They included 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with hepatoblastoma, 6 with childhood atopic dermatitis, and 3 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 The dosages ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 U/kg every 8 hours by intravenous drip.
 The following side effects were observed: anorexia, fever, and chillness (100%), general malaise (82%), irritability (64%), diarrhea (100%), nausea and vomiting (73%), weight gain (82%), edema (82%), abdominal distension (73%), oliguria (82%), cough (91%), dyspnea (27%), pleural effusion (40%), hypotension (82%), skin eruption (82%), oral ulcer (18%), enlarged liver (73%) liver function abnormalities (82%), renal function impairment (36%), electrolyte imbalance (73%), anemia (91%), thrombocytopenia (54%), leukopenia (18%), and eosinophilia (73%).
 Immunologically, numbers of natural killer cells were increased and natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities were augmented after IL-2 treatment.
 There was a tendency for serum levels of IL-2 and receptor IL-2 to decrease, especially in patients with atopic eczema.
 Ten patients (91%) completed one course (9 to 12 days) of therapy, and the remaining patient interrupted the treatment because of intolerable adverse effects.
 Clinically, complete remission for 3 months was obtained in 1 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patient, transient improvement (2 to 6 weeks) in all atopic dermatitis patients, minor response in the hepatoblastoma patient, and no response in the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.

 Success of programs to screen newborns for sickle cell disease depends on timely follow-up.
 Education regarding fever and splenic palpation, and initiation of prophylactic penicillin therapy, will reduce morbidity and mortality and should occur prior to 4 months of age.
 However, contacting parents to permit implementation of care may be difficult, particularly in large urban populations; only nine (36%) of 25 infants recently identified as having sickle cell disease arrived at our institution for initial appointments.

"Massive increases in extracellular potassium and the indiscriminate release of glutamate following concussive brain injury.
 An increase in extracellular K+ concentration ([K+]c) of the rat hippocampus following fluid-percussion concussive brain injury was demonstrated with microdialysis.
 The role of neuronal discharge was examined with in situ administration of 0.1 mM tetrodotoxin, a potent depressant of neuronal discharges, and of 0.5 to 20 mM cobalt, a blocker of Ca++ channels.
 While a small short-lasting [K+]c increase (1.40- to 2.15-fold) was observed after a mild insult, a more pronounced longer-lasting increase (4.28- to 5.90-fold) was induced without overt morphological damage as the severity of injury rose above a certain threshold (unconscious for 200 to 250 seconds).
 The small short-lasting increase was reduced with prior administration of tetrodotoxin but not with cobalt, indicating that neuronal discharges are the source of this increase.
 In contrast, the larger longer-lasting increase was resistant to tetrodotoxin and partially dependent on Ca++, suggesting that neurotransmitter release is involved.
 In order to test the hypothesis that the release of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter glutamate mediates this increase in [K+]c, the extracellular concentration of glutamate ([Glu]c) was measured along with [K+]c.
 The results indicate that a relatively specific increase in [Glu]c (as compared with other amino acids) was induced concomitantly with the increase in [K+]c.
 Furthermore, the in situ administration of 1 to 25 mM kynurenic acid, an excitatory amino acid antagonist, effectively attenuated the increase in [K+]c.
 A dose-response curve suggested that a maximum effect of kynurenic acid is obtained at a concentration that substantially blocks all receptor subtypes of excitatory amino acids.
 These data suggest that concussive brain injury causes a massive K+ flux which is likely to be related to an indiscriminate release of excitatory amino acids occurring immediately after brain injury.

"Arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy 
 This prospective study evaluated the incidence and severity of arterial oxygen desaturation during gastrointestinal endoscopy.
 Following pulmonary function testing, 115 male patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy, or colonoscopy followed by EGD, with continuous recording of arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2).
 Most patients (80/115, 70%) showed arterial oxygen desaturation (greater than 4% decrease from baseline SaO2); severe arterial oxygen desaturation (SaO2 less than or equal to 85%) reflecting hypoxemia (PaO2 less than or equal to 50 mm Hg) was noted in one-third of patients overall (37/115, 32%).
 Severe arterial oxygen desaturation occurred in 9/62 EGD patients (15%), 23/46 colonoscopy patients (50%), and 4/7 patients having colonoscopy followed by EGD (57%).
 Arterial oxygen desaturation occurs frequently during gastrointestinal endoscopy and is often severe.
 These data support the concept that continuous monitoring of SaO2 should be standard procedure during all gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures.

"Effects of fish-oil ingestion on cardiovascular risk factors in hyperlipidemic subjects in Israel: a randomized, double-blind crossover study.
 Effects of a daily fish-oil supplement on serum lipids, apolipoproteins, and some platelet functions and hemorheologic variables were examined in 27 hyperlipidemic subjects in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, crossover fashion with an identically encapsulated vegetable oil serving as the control treatment.
 Despite the habitual high linoleic acid intake of the study population, significant incorporation of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids into the serum, platelet, and erythrocyte lipids was observed after the fish-oil supplement.
 Ingestion of fish oil resulted in a 40% decrease in the triglyceride concentration, a 12% increase in HDL cholesterol, and a significant decrease in plasma viscosity, whereas the vegetable-oil placebo had no significant effect.
 We conclude that a moderate intake of fish oil (15 g/d) is a feasible treatment for hypertriglyceridemia even in patients with a background of high linoleic acid intake and that it may have a beneficial effect on several cardiovascular risk factors.

"Arterial vasodilator effects of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine alone and in combination with verapamil in systemic hypertension.
 The arterial vasodilator properties of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine were compared with the effects of vascular muscle cyclic guanosine monophosphate production by sodium nitroprusside and with the effects of a combined infusion of amlodipine and the nondihydropyridine calcium antagonist verapamil in 8 untreated patients with primary hypertension.
 Arterial vasodilation was assessed by measurement of changes of forearm blood flow by mercury in Silastic strain-gauge plethysmography during brachial artery drug infusions.
 Forearm blood flow increased during amlodipine infusions (0.4 to 45 micrograms/min/100 ml forearm tissue) from 2.9 +/- 1.7 to a maximum of 23.6 +/- 7.6 ml/min/100 ml (687%), while sodium nitroprusside caused an increase from 3.0 +/- 1.8 to 16.2 +/- 5.4 ml/min/100 ml (449%), attesting to the importance of transmembrane calcium influx for the maintenance of vascular tone.
 The addition of verapamil 40 micrograms/min/100 ml to an infusion of amlodipine 44.5 micrograms/min/100 ml resulted in a further increase of forearm blood flow, from 23.6 +/- 7.6 to 34.4 +/- 9.8 ml/min/100 ml (p less than 0.05).
 The precise mechanisms of this finding have yet to be elucidated but may be due to interactions of the effects of the binding of these 2 chemically and pharmacologically different calcium antagonists to distinct binding sites at calcium channels.
 The clinical relevance of this observation for the treatment of coronary artery disease and systemic hypertension needs further study.

 Linear regression with reasonably homogeneous variances have been found when the BAL at 2, 2.5 and 3 hr are divided by the person's body weight and plotted versus the g/kg (D/W) dose.
 Error analysis indicated that the least error in the predicted dose (D/W) was obtained for BAL measured at 2 hr post dosing.
 In the latter case the mean absolute error was 6.23%, 59% of the errors were within +/- 5% and 88% of the errors were within +/- 10%.

"Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results).
 The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4.3 years).
 A control group consisted of 14 patients who underwent radical surgery and finished a course of prophylactic postoperative mebendazole treatment of 2 years.
 In the controls, no recurrence was observed after a post-therapy period averaging 3.5 years.
 In contrast, recurrence occurred in 7/19 patients (37%) with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis an average of 1.6 years after discontinuation of the long-term mebendazole therapy.
 The absence of clinically detectable recurrence in the remaining 12 patients seems to be due either to spontaneous inactivation of alveolar echinococcosis preceding chemotherapy or too short post-therapy surveillance.
 The patients with recurrence responded favorably to reintroduction of chemotherapy.
 The data indicate that mebendazole therapy is parasitostatic rather than parasiticidal.

"Estimation of Reynolds stresses within the Penn State left ventricular assist device.
 Fluid velocities were measured using a two-component laser Doppler anemometery (LDA) system at 129 locations within a Plexiglas model of a 70 cm3 Penn State electric Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD).
 The LVAD was driven by a pulsatile piston pump acting on an attached segmented polyurethane diaphragm.
 Bjork-Shiley tilting disc valves were used to provide unidirectional flow through the inlet and outlet ports.
 A seeded blood analog fluid, which matched the kinematic viscosity of blood at high shear rates and the refractive index of Plexiglas, was used to make the measurements.
 At each location, 250 instantaneous velocity realizations were collected at eight instances during the pump cycle.
 The maximum Reynolds shear and normal stresses were calculated for each pump cycle time and location after filtering the data.
 The results reveal that the highest Reynolds shear and normal stresses occur in the near wall region just proximal to the aortic valve during diastole, and reach values of 5,300 dynes/cm2 and 10,800 dynes/cm2, respectively.
 The elevated turbulent stresses are observed during the period of regurgitant flow through the aortic valve, with peak stress values arising during the period of peak regurgitant flow.
 This supports the hypothesis that a regurgitant turbulent jet is formed near the wall of the prosthetic aortic valve and may be contributing to blood damage.

"Sensitivity for detecting fibrillation potentials: a comparison between concentric and monopolar needle electrodes.
 The sensitivity of monopolar and concentric electrodes for detecting fibrillation potentials (FP) has never been formally compared.
 We studied 35 muscles with FP, sampling 20 sites each with concentric and monopolar needles.
 The concentric needle identified 0.88 +/- 3.44 (mean +/- standard deviation) more sites with spontaneous activity.
 Although statistically significant (Wilcoxon signed rank test P less than .03), this difference in sensitivity did not appreciably affect diagnostic interpretation.
 Subjects described the concentric needles as more painful.
 Needle insertions in 25 other muscles demonstrated that needle movement generated the majority of FP.
 We suggest that the increased tissue injury caused by concentric needles may account for both their increased sensitivity and discomfort.

"Diffusing capacity of the lung and nifedipine in systemic sclerosis.
 Lung involvement in systemic sclerosis may be due in part to a functional abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature.
 To investigate the possible role of a pulmonary vasospastic process in this disorder, 21 non-smoking patients who had no evidence of cardiac disease or pulmonary hypertension were evaluated with pulmonary function tests prior to administration of nifedipine, 30 minutes after a single oral dose of nifedipine (20 mg), and after 4 weeks of treatment with nifedipine (10 mg 3 times daily).
 Treatment with nifedipine did not significantly change any of the pulmonary function values, except for the carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO).
 The linear trend between the individual DLCO values at baseline and their changes immediately following the initial 20-mg dose of nifedipine (r = -0.603, P = 0.02) and after 4 weeks of treatment (r = -0.636, P = 0.01) showed that the lower the DLCO value at baseline, the greater the improvement caused by nifedipine.
 These findings support the hypothesis of a potentially reversible pulmonary vasospasm in systemic sclerosis and suggest that nifedipine may be useful in the treatment of lung disease in these patients; however, further studies are needed.

"Double-peaking circadian variation in the occurrence of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias.
 We studied 251 patients less than or equal to 65 years of age admitted for treatment of symptomatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmia to assess whether these arrhythmias begin evenly throughout the day or manifest circadian variation in occurrence.
 The arrhythmias included 152 episodes of atrial fibrillation, 50 episodes of supraventricular reentry tachycardia, 30 episodes of atrial flutter, and 19 cases of ectopic atrial tachycardia.
 A total of 209 patients could tell the exact time their symptoms had started.
 In 38 of them (18%), the arrhythmia had begun between midnight and 6:00 AM, in 63 (30%) between 6:01 AM and noon, in 46 (22%) between noon and 6:00 PM, and in 62 (30%) between 6:01 PM and midnight.
 This distribution differed significantly from uniform occurrence (chi square 8.7, p less than 0.05).
 Fifty patients were using beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents when the arrhythmia occurred.
 Compared with the other 159 patients, they had no morning surge of arrhythmias (20% versus 33.3% of episodes between 6:01 AM and noon), but instead a much higher incidence at night (34% versus 13.2% of episodes between midnight and 6:00 AM) (chi square 14.4, p less than 0.005).
 We conclude that the frequency of onset of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias varies with the time of day, showing nearly equal peaks in the morning and in the evening and a trough at night.
 The modifying effect of beta-adrenoceptor blockage suggests that many morning arrhythmias are of adrenergic origin while other, probably vagal arrhythmogenic mechanisms, prevail at night.

"Antigenic recognition by intravenous gamma-globulin of selected bacteria isolated from throats of patients with Kawasaki syndrome.
 Kawasaki syndrome (KS) or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome is an acute febrile exanthematous illness of unknown etiology.
 Therapy with intravenous gamma-globulin (IVGG) results in rapid defervescence, disappearance of signs and symptoms of inflammation and prevention of coronary artery aneurysms.
 We hypothesized that IVGG might neutralize a bacterial toxin produced by a staphylococcus or streptococcus present in the nasopharynx.
 We further speculated that this toxin might be detectable in serum or urine of patients.
 The goal of this work was to identify microbial antigens in different materials taken from patients with a clinical diagnosis of KS.
 We tested 23 aerobic bacterial isolates from throat cultures from 15 patients with KS, acute serum from 121 patients and 38 acute urine specimens from patients with KS.
 The patients ranged in age from 1 to 6 years.
 Specimens were tested in a standard system of counterimmunoelectrophoresis and reacted against IVGG prepared in a 25% solution.
 Ten of 23 aerobic bacteria (43.5%) isolated from throat cultures demonstrated a precipitation reaction with IVGG.
 Counterimmunoelectrophoresis testing of IVGG against acute serum and acute urine specimens was uniformly negative.
 IVGG contains precipitating antibody against a limited number of aerobic throat organisms.
 It is possible that antigenic products of one of these bacteria may be involved in the pathogenesis of KS.

 Twenty-two (88%) of 25 grafts in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 23 (96%) of 24 grafts in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group were clear after 1 year; best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was noted in 25% of the eyes in the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group and 29% of the eyes in the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group.
 The mean intraocular pressure for the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group was significantly lower than for the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group at 3 months (17 +/- 4 vs 21 +/- 7 mm Hg) and at 6 months (17 +/- 3 vs 20 +/- 5 mm Hg); but did not differ at 1 year.
 The mean percent of endothelial cell loss after 1 year did not differ between the anterior-chamber intraocular lens group (32% +/- 26%) and the sutured posterior-chamber intraocular lens group (27% +/- 26%).

 This study enrolled 253 patients with severe heart failure (New York Heart Association functional class IV) from 35 centers in Scandinavia, randomly assigned to treatment with placebo or enalapril, in addition to their usual treatment for heart failure.
 After an initial titration period, the daily doses of enalapril ranged from 2.5 to 40 mg.
 At the end of the trial, 46% of the placebo-treated patients and 61% of the enalapril-treated patients were alive (p = 0.003); the survival figures at 8 months after completion of the trial were 32 and 48%, respectively (p = 0.001); and 21 and 30%, respectively (p = 0.006) at the 2-year follow-up.
 In the placebo group, there was a significant positive association between mortality and baseline levels of norepinephrine, epinephrine, angiotensin II, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide; no such association was found in the enalapril-treated patients.
 The results suggest that the effects of enalapril on mortality are related to a counteraction of the neuroendocrine activation in general and to the renin-angiotensin system in particular.

 Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs) are associated with white cell (WBC) antibodies.
 The purposes of this study were to determine the frequency of WBC antibodies, to associate the severity of reactions with antibody specificity, and to distinguish FNHTRs from infection and postoperative fever.
 By using the granulocyte indirect immunofluorescence test in conjunction with lymphocytotoxicity testing, it was found that 70 percent of FNHTRs in 24 patients involved WBC antibodies.
 The remaining 30 percent of apparent FNHTRs were associated with infections and postoperative fever.
 Granulocyte-specific antibodies were as prevalent as HLA antibodies and were associated with the severest reactions.
 Because FNHTRs occur with granulocyte-specific antibodies, HLA antibodies, and possible monocyte-specific antibodies (untested in this and other studies), these reactions could be grouped together as WBC-associated reactions.

"Can the status of tubal pregnancy be predicted with transvaginal sonography? A prospective comparison of sonographic, surgical, and serum hCG findings 
 Results of transvaginal sonography were compared prospectively with surgical findings and levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin in 120 women with a proved tubal pregnancy.
 The most common sonographic finding was a saclike adnexal ring, which was seen in 74 of the women (61.7%).
 This finding was strongly associated with functioning trophoblasts and with an intact fallopian tube.
 In 39 of the women (32.5%) an adnexal mass with a complex texture was found.
 Of these 39 women, 20 had a tubal hematoma and six had a ruptured fallopian tube.
 The size of the tubal mass created by ectopic pregnancy was predicted precisely (r = .91, P less than .001), and transvaginal sonography enabled detection of hemoperitoneum with a sensitivity of 91% (68 of 75 women).
 This study suggests that the status of a tubal pregnancy can be predicted reliably on the basis of transvaginal sonographic findings.

 A central anomaly in the pathogenesis of AIDS is that few actively infected CD4+ cells (1 in 10(4)-10(5) have been detected in the peripheral blood, even though dramatic depletion (often greater than 90%) of CD4+ cells is the hallmark of disease progression.
 A sensitive, 35S-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA in situ hybridization technique was coupled with a new detection method, confocal laser scanning microscopy, to examine transcriptionally active HIV-infected cells from individuals at different disease stages.
 In 35 symptomatic HIV-infected individuals (AIDS and AIDS related complex), an average of 1 in 350 mononuclear cells produced HIV RNA.
 In contrast, in an asymptomatic group of 30 individuals, an average of 1 in 2000 mononuclear cells produced HIV RNA.
 These data, obtained using this improved detection method, suggest there are more HIV RNA-producing cells in HIV-infected individuals than previously reported.
 In addition, increased numbers of HIV transcribing cells were found to correlate with declining clinical condition as assessed by Karnofsky performance score.
 These data suggest that viremia per se may account for the pathologic consequences in HIV infection.

 Patients with only one of these risk factors (n = 72) had a 24% prevalence of silent infarction.
 Infarction was more common in those with chronic (34%) as opposed to intermittent (22%) nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but this difference was not significant.
 Hypertension, diabetes, duration of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were not associated with asymptomatic infarction.
 A history of hypertension was present in only 35% of our patients with small-deep asymptomatic infarction, similar to the percentage in patients without stroke.
 Asymptomatic cerebral infarction is common in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.
 The association with enlarged left atria and the lack of correlation with major cerebrovascular risk factors suggests a cardioembolic mechanism.
 Further study is needed to determine the functional and prognostic significance of these strokes.

"Allogeneic marrow transplantation in patients with acute myeloid leukemia in first remission: a randomized trial of two irradiation regimens 
 A randomized trial of 12.0 Gy versus 15.75 Gy of total body irradiation (TBI) was performed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia undergoing allogeneic marrow transplantation while in first complete remission.
 All patients received 120 mg/kg cyclophosphamide followed by TBI and marrow from HLA-identical siblings.
 Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
 Thirty-four patients received 2.0-Gy fractions of irradiation daily for 6 days and 37 received 2.25-Gy fractions daily for 7 days.
 The 3-year actuarial probabilities for relapse-free survival were 0.58 for the patients who received 12.0 Gy and 0.59 for those who received 15.75 Gy.
 The 3-year probabilities of relapse were 0.35 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.12 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .06).
 The 3-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 0.12 and 0.32, respectively (P = .04).
 The probability of moderate to severe acute GVHD was 0.21 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.48 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .02).
 Patients exposed to the higher irradiation dose received less immunoprophylaxis against, and had a higher incidence of, acute GVHD.
 The increased dose of TBI significantly reduced the probability of relapse but did not improve survival because of increased mortality from causes other than relapse.

"Effect of cyclosporin on generalized Shwartzman reaction in diabetic rats.
 The effect of cyclosporin (CsA) on the endotoxin-induced generalized Shwartzman reaction (GSR) was studied in diabetic and nondiabetic rats.
 After 4.5 wk of diabetes, CsA (20 mg/kg) or intralipid as a control substance was given intraperitoneally daily for 10 days.
 Next, diabetic rats were given either high-dose (2 mg/kg or low-dose (0.1 mg/kg) endotoxin (Escherichia coli 026:B6 lipopolysaccharide B) as a single injection.
 The rats were killed at intervals of 1, 4, 8, and 24 h.
 No significant glomerular thrombi were seen in the nondiabetic control animals, whereas the severity of glomerular thrombi in the diabetic animals was dependent on the presence or absence of CsA, endotoxin dose, and degree of glycemic control.
 In the diabetic rats, glomerular thrombi occurred maximally at 4 h but were no longer present at 24 h.
 The CsA/high-dose-endotoxin rats had fewer glomerular thrombi than rats receiving the intralipid/high-dose endotoxin, but this difference was not statistically significant.
 The CsA/low-dose-endotoxin rats had increased glomerular thrombi compared with the intralipid/low-dose-endotoxin rats (P less than 0.01).
 Insulin treatment reduced the glomerular capillary thrombi in the CsA/low-dose-endotoxin diabetic animals.
 Thus, CsA aggravates the GSR with low-dose endotoxin but has no significant effect when high-dose endotoxin is given.
 Improved glycemic control reduces the GSR in CsA-treated rats.
 Thus, the interrelationships of diabetes, endotoxin, and CsA on the GSR are complex, and the pathogenesis of these events is unclear.

"Effects of calcium channel blockade on calcium homeostasis in mild to moderate essential hypertension.
 Calcium channel blockers may alter parathyroid hormone secretion in vitro, which would alter calcium homeostasis.
 To determine the chronic effect of calcium channel blockade in vivo, we conducted a randomized, double blind, 16 week study comparing the effects of two pharmacologic antihypertensive agents, the calcium channel blocker diltiazem and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on parameters of calcium homeostasis.
 Both diltiazem and captopril lowered blood pressure to a similar degree.
 Neither drug produced any significant change in blood levels of total and ionized calcium, magnesium, or phosphorus, which affect the regulation of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D.
 In addition, at eight or 16 weeks following initiation, neither drug altered the serum levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or 1,25-(OH)2-vitamin D3 (1,25-D).
 Chronic calcium channel blockade with diltiazem does not alter serum parameters of calcium homeostasis and, thus, should not affect bone mineralization.

"Glucose disposal, beta-cell secretion, and hepatic insulin extraction in cirrhosis: a minimal model assessment.
 Factors controlling glucose metabolism after IV load were studied in nine patients with compensated cirrhosis and in six age-matched controls.
 The time courses of glucose, insulin, and C peptide were analyzed by means of the minimal model technique.
 In cirrhosis, insulin sensitivity was reduced by approximately 70% and glucose-dependent glucose uptake (glucose effectiveness) by 45%.
 Decreased glucose effectiveness explained 65% of the variance of glucose disappearance and correlated with the ratio of urinary creatinine to height, an independent measure of muscle mass (r = 0.839).
 beta-cell responsiveness to glucose, measured on C-peptide kinetics, was variable and increased on average by 170% and 107% (first-phase and second-phase, respectively).
 The total amount of insulin secreted by beta-cells in the course of the study was nearly doubled, whereas the basal insulin secretion rate was in the normal range.
 The time courses of hepatic extraction of insulin did not differ between groups, and basal extraction was on average 58% in controls and 56% in patients with cirrhosis.
 It was reduced to 30% in a single patient who had severe hepatocellular failure and large spontaneous portosystemic shunting.
 We conclude that the alterations in glucose metabolism of cirrhosis include a decreased insulin sensitivity, a reduced glucose effectiveness, and an increased pancreatic responsiveness to glucose, leading to hyperinsulinemia.
 The hepatic extraction of insulin is reduced only in the very advanced stages of the disease, possibly because of a large reserve capacity of the hepatic parenchyma.

"Imbalance between the mechanisms of activation and inhibition of metalloproteases in the early lesions of experimental osteoarthritis.
 Levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP) and plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin were measured and the distribution of PA was studied by immunohistochemical techniques in cartilage and synovium samples from dogs subjected to sectioning of the anterior cruciate ligament of their right knees and sham operation of their left knees (controls).
 Twenty-three animals were divided into 3 groups and killed at 2, 4, or 8 weeks after surgery.
 The levels of PA and plasmin were found to be significantly elevated in the osteoarthritic (OA) knee cartilage and synovium at all times after surgery, except for levels of PA in the OA cartilage at 2 weeks.
 There was a positive correlation between the levels of PA and plasmin in the synovial membrane (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001).
 In OA knees, the presence of high levels of total and active collagenase was detected in cartilage and in synovium.
 The levels of these 2 forms of collagenase showed a positive correlation both in cartilage (r = 0.65, P less than 0.001) and in synovium (r = 0.77, P less than 0.001).
 The levels of TIMP in cartilage from OA and sham operated knees were similar.
 Although the TIMP level was increased in the OA synovium, it was found only in trace amounts in cartilage.
 Immunohistochemical studies revealed that both forms of PA, urokinase-type PA and tissue-type PA, and TIMP were present in OA tissues.
 In the synovium, they were found mainly in monocyte/macrophages, synovial lining cells, and blood vessel cells.
 In OA cartilage, PA was present only at the superficial level in chondrocytes and in cartilage matrix, whereas TIMP was present in chondrocyte lacunae throughout the full thickness of the cartilage.
 TIMP was also detected in the superficial level of cartilage from sham operated knees.
 The results of this study indicate that in OA tissues, there are conditions that favor the synthesis and activation of metalloproteases.
 PA and plasmin are likely to play an important role in the physiologic activation of metalloproteases, although they are probably not the only system involved in this process.
 The lack of increased TIMP levels in the OA cartilage, in the presence of increased metalloprotease activity, is also a possible contributing factor in the enzymatic degradation of this tissue.

"The ""stuck twin"" phenomenon: ultrasonographic findings, pregnancy outcome, and management with serial amniocenteses.
 Thirteen consecutive twin pregnancies affected by the ""stuck twin"" phenomenon were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of serial amniocenteses.
 The fetal survival rate for the eight pregnancies that underwent serial amniocenteses was 69% (11 of 16 fetuses).
 This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01).
 It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001).
 Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities.
 Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal death in one case.
 Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including brain infarction and renal tubular necrosis.
 Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors.

"In vivo assessment of shock-wave pressures. Implication for biliary lithotripsy.
 During extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy, the pressure profile, which is generated by the lithotriptor, determines the risk of tissue damage.
 In the present study, the pressure distribution of a lithotriptor (Lithostar; Siemens A.G., Erlangen, Federal Republic of Germany) was investigated in 10 pigs, five of which had gallstones surgically implanted into the gallbladder.
 The in vivo values were compared with in vitro data.
 Measurements were carried out along the shock-wave transmission path at the focus within the gallbladder, the adjacent liver, the diaphragmatic surface of the right lung, and the shock-wave exit site from the skin.
 Interposition of ribs did not cause a significant decrease in focal positive pressure.
 However, a gallstone positioned in the focus caused a 30%-65% reduction in pressure, recorded immediately behind the stone.
 Pressures obtained in vivo were always 15%-25% lower than those measured in vitro.
 The spatial distributions of the positive pressure in vivo and in vitro were almost identical.
 There was a high correlation between the pressures in vitro and in vivo (r = 0.88; P less than or equal to 0.01).
 This justifies assessment of shock-wave energies generated during biliary lithotripsy by extrapolation of in vitro data.
 It is concluded that it is possible to characterize different lithotriptors by in vitro pressure profile measurements.

"Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion in the United Kingdom: survey of clinical practice.
 Malignant pleural effusions are often symptomatic and tend to recur after simple aspiration.
 Pleurodesis may prevent recurrence of the effusion; many agents and techniques have been described.
 A questionnaire was sent to 448 clinicians in the United Kingdom to determine how pleurodesis is performed in practice.
 There was a 56% overall response, with replies from 101 respiratory physicians, 88 general physicians, 29 thoracic surgeons, and 35 general surgeons.
 General surgeons saw few cases of malignant pleural effusion and rarely performed pleurodesis.
 A patient with recurrent malignant pleural effusion would usually be managed with pleurodesis by 76 (76%) respiratory physicians, 26 (30%) general physicians, and 23 (81%) thoracic surgeons; a further 29 (33%) general physicians would refer such patients to another specialist.
 Most medical pleurodesis were performed by junior staff, whereas consultant thoracic surgeons were more likely to be concerned with the procedure.
 All the thoracic surgeons used an intercostal tube drain, usually with suction.
 An intercostal tube drain was used routinely by only 54 (54%) of the respiratory physicians and 28 (32%) general physicians.
 Thoracic surgeons preferred talc for pleurodesis whereas physicians most commonly used tetracycline.
 The variety of methods in use supports the need for randomised, controlled studies to determine the most effective technique of pleurodesis.

"A nongastrin malignant ampullary tumor causing gastric acid and pepsin hypersecretion. A case report.
 We report a case of multiple duodenal ulcers with gastric hypersecretion due to a nongastrin secretagogue produced by a malignant tumor of the pancreas in a 78-year-old man.
 The case resembled a Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) with high acid output (basal acid output 27, sham meal-stimulated 37, maximum acid output 47 mEq/h), but with fasting gastrin 43 pg/ml, nonresponsive to secretin.
 As in ZES, pepsin output was comparatively low, and secretion was inhibitable by atropine (50% inhibited by 1 microM).
 The tumor removed at surgery contained less than 1 ng gastrin per gram, but was many times more potent than pentagastrin in stimulating acid from a lumen-perfused rat stomach.
 The tumor also contained cholecystokinin (CCK-8 and CCK-33), motilin, insulin, and somatostatin, which were also present in adjacent normal pancreas; in addition, the tumor contained pancreatic polypeptide and pancreatic cancer-associated antigen.
 This case represents a rare syndrome due to an as yet undefined peptide secreted by a (frequently malignant) pancreatic endocrine tumor and masquerading as ZES.
 This is the first report of studies of pepsin secretion and of the effect of atropine, suggesting that the physiologic effects of the secretagogue resemble that of gastrin.

"Cholangiocarcinoma.
 The diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma can now be made with greater rapidity and accuracy.
 In the clinical setting of obstructive jaundice, a CT scan or sonogram may suggest cholangiocarcinoma if dilated intrahepatic ducts are seen with a nondilated extrahepatic biliary tree.
 The diagnosis is confirmed by cholangiography, and the tumor is staged by the combination of cholangiography and angiography.
 If the tumor extensively involves both lobes of the liver or involves the main portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion is considered unresectable.
 These patients are best palliated nonoperatively, but they should still have an attempt at a tissue diagnosis, as various other lesions can masquerade as cholangiocarcinoma.
 In comparison, if the tumor is confined to or is distal to the hepatic duct bifurcation, extends into only one lobe of the liver, or involves only the right or the left portal vein or hepatic artery, the lesion may be resectable, and exploration is indicated.
 As many as half of all patients explored with curative intent will have a successful resection.
 Various surgical options are appropriate for patients undergoing tumor resection, depending on the site and extent of the lesion.
 Similarly, several surgical options are possible for palliation in patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma.
 The role of radiotherapy in the management of cholangiocarcinoma is uncertain.
 Our results, like those of many other retrospective analyses, suggest that radiotherapy prolongs survival after curative resection as well as after palliative stenting.
 However, further data from randomized studies are necessary to support or refute this impression.
 Further studies of adjuvant chemotherapy or hormonal therapy will also be necessary to improve patient survival.

 Thirty-four patients with incurable solid tumors were treated in a Phase I trial with a fixed dose of high-dose cisplatin (CDDP) administered in hypertonic saline and escalating doses of infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
 Five treatment levels of 5-FU, ranging from 500 to 900 mg/m2/day for 5 days, were studied.
 Leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and oral mucositis were the dose-limiting toxicities encountered.
 Nephrotoxicity was minimal.
 Ototoxicity and peripheral neuropathies were rare and mild in this patient group, but most patients received only a small number of treatment cycles.
 Diarrhea was not dose-limiting.
 Two complete responses (one non-small cell lung cancer and one sweat gland carcinoma) were observed.
 No other major responses were noted.
 With the dose of CDDP set at 35 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a concurrent 5-day 5-FU infusion was found to be 900 mg/m2/day.
 The recommended dosages for Phase II trials are 35 mg/m2/day CDDP and 800 mg/m2/day 5-FU for 5 consecutive days.

"Role of insulin in management of surgical patients with diabetes mellitus.
 Because surgery is a likely event during the lifetime of patients with diabetes, health-care team members need to be aware of the metabolic problems that may occur during the perioperative period.
 Surgery, especially in the presence of general anesthesia, will produce a diabetogenic response.
 This is generally due to an elevation of counterregulatory hormones, although endogenous insulin is also suppressed.
 The excessive lipolysis and ketogenesis that can occur during surgery can have particularly deleterious effects for patients with diabetes.
 Thus, sufficient insulin must be provided during this period to suppress these catabolic processes.
 The major controversy regarding surgery and diabetes concerns the route of insulin administration.
 This article reviews the various treatment options for patients with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, with particular emphasis on the role of insulin.

"Surgical treatment of renal artery stenosis after failed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
 From 1980 to 1989, 53 patients with renovascular hypertension underwent surgical treatment after initial unsuccessful management with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
 Renal artery stenosis was due to fibrous dysplasia in 17 patients and atherosclerosis in 36.
 The reasons for failure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty were inability to dilate the stenotic lesion (32 patients), acute renal arterial occlusion (2) or dissection (8) from attempted percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, and the development of recurrent renal artery stenosis after initially successful percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (11).
 Three patients underwent nephrectomy due to the finding of a nonviable kidney at operation.
 Successful surgical revascularization was achieved in 50 patients.
 There was no significant fibrosis or inflammation around the previously dilated renal artery.
 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty necessitated performance of a more complicated revascularization operation in only 1 patient.
 If the kidney is viable at operation in patients treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty renovascular reconstruction is not more technically difficult than when done primarily and the same excellent results can be achieved.

 To assess the increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) with growth, FRC was measured after induction of anesthesia in two groups of children.
 One group consisted of 74 children, 0.1-11.2 yr of age, without signs of cardiorespiratory disease (referred to here as ""normal"" children), and the other of 21 children, 0.2-6.9 yr of age, with cardiac malformations.
 Anesthesia was maintained with halothane in the normal children and with fentanyl, droperidol, and nitrous oxide in the children with cardiac anomalies.
 All patients were paralyzed, their tracheas intubated, and their lungs mechanically ventilated.
 FRC was measured with an automated tracer gas washout technique.
 In 70 patients the measurements were performed in duplicate with a mean coefficient of variation of 2.0%.
 FRC correlated significantly with height, weight, and age in both groups.

 Acute autonomic neuropathy is an uncommon syndrome, usually affecting healthy young people.
 Presentation is often dramatic and initial misdiagnosis is common.
 We describe two young women with acute autonomic neuropathy who presented with gastrointestinal involvement heralding widespread dysautonomia and review 26 additional cases of acute autonomic neuropathy from the English language literature.
 Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions.
 Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks.
 Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints.
 Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes.
 Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension.

 Acute autonomic neuropathy shares several clinical features with acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome), suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis.

"Effect of tamoxifen on serum insulinlike growth factor I levels in stage I breast cancer patients.
 Insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I) has been shown to be a potent mitogen for breast cancer cells in vitro, and IGF-I receptors have been demonstrated on human primary breast neoplasms.
 In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, we document that administration of the antiestrogen tamoxifen to patients with breast cancer was associated with a statistically significant (P = .002) reduction in the serum level of IGF-I.
 The mean IGF-I level was 1.4 U/mL in the placebo-treated group and 0.9 U/mL in the tamoxifen-treated group.
 Because serum IGF-I level is growth hormone (GH) dependent and because data suggest that the pubertal surge in GH and IGF-I levels is sex steroid dependent, we speculate that the mechanism underlying our observation may involve blockade by tamoxifen of estrogen action in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis.
 We conclude that tamoxifen treatment reduces IGF-I levels and that this reduction may contribute to the therapeutic effect of the drug.

 First, drug therapy should never be considered without adequate dietary intervention.
 Dietary therapy may be effective for many patients with mild to moderate elevations in cholesterol.
 None of the drugs used to treat lipid disorders are benign agents.
 There is still debate about the interpretations of recent studies, the ability to generalize from studies to the whole population, and the cost effectiveness of drug treatment.
 Within the framework of the AHA and NCEP guidelines, an individualized approach to therapy is prudent.
 This should be initiated with maximal patient education because drug therapy will be maintained for the long-term or for life.

"Evaluation of the AIDS dementia complex in clinical trials.
 The AIDS dementia complex (ADC) is one of the most common and important causes of morbidity associated with infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 The evaluation of ADC in clinical trials is significant not only because of the clinical impact of this syndrome, but also because of the value of measuring its cardinal features as an index of drug efficacy and because of its emerging role as a major clinical end point.
 The objectives of therapy include both prevention of ADC in the presymptomatic patient and alleviation of established disease.
 At present, the pathogenesis of ADC is incompletely understood in several critical aspects, particularly the processes underlying the clinical manifestations of central nervous system (CNS) HIV-1 infection and, further, how such processes are related to systemic disease.
 Consequently, it is not yet clear to what extent, or in which patients, it is necessary to achieve ""therapeutic"" drug levels within the CNS.
 Nevertheless, the assessment of ADC prevention and treatment relies principally on the complementary approach of neurological examination for diagnosis and neuropsychological testing for quantitative serial measurement of treatment effects.
 Additionally, surrogate markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may hold promise for objective, rapid assessment of treatment response and dose adjustment.
 Other measurements, including more routine CSF analysis, neuroimaging, and neurophysiological assessments, are used principally for differential diagnosis rather than for monitoring ADC status.
 Accumulating experience with available antiviral agents suggests that ADC can be effectively prevented and treated, at least for some period of time, and that assessment of this condition is indeed a valuable approach for measuring antiviral therapy.

 A skin biopsy specimen obtained from a visibly normal but hypoesthetic area on the back demonstrated a few acid-fast bacteria in small dermal nerves, in arrector pili smooth muscle, and in rare perivascular histiocytes, associated with a sparse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate.
 The patient responded well to therapy with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazamine.
 A classification and review of primarily neural leprosy is presented.
 Our patient represents the first reported case of primarily neural borderline lepromatous leprosy in Canada.

"The latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for extremity reconstruction in orthopedic surgery.
 The latissimus dorsi was transferred as a pedicle flap in ten patients and as a free vascular flap in ten others for extremity reconstruction.
 Group I comprised ten patients in whom the transfer was used solely to cover a skin or soft-tissue defect.
 Although there was partial necrosis of the transferred skin in one patient, the remaining nine patients obtained complete coverage without further reconstructive surgery.
 Group II comprised five patients in whom transfer of the latissimus dorsi was performed for active flexion or extension of the elbow or for abduction of the shoulder.
 Postoperatively, muscle strength obtained was classified from Grades 0 to 5 according to the muscle testing method.
 Three patients obtained muscle strength of Grade 3, while two obtained Grade 2.
 Group III comprised five patients who had brachial plexus palsy after high-dose irradiation.
 Coverage of the skin and soft tissue was performed after neurolysis of the brachial plexus palsy to free the tissue bed of scarred tissue.
 Postoperatively, sensory and motor disturbances were alleviated in four of five patients.

"Cytoreductive hepatic surgery for neuroendocrine tumors.
 We retrospectively reviewed 37 patients who underwent hepatic resection between 1970 and 1989 to evaluate the role of cytoreductive hepatic surgery in patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid, 24; islet cell, 13).
 Seventeen resections were curative (no gross residual tumor); nine patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and seven patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor.
 Eight of nine patients with symptomatic endorcrinopathies obtained complete relief of symptoms; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 2 to 82 months (mean, 26 months).
 Six of seven patients with symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; five are alive with no evidence of disease at 5 to 28 months (mean, 14 months).
 One symptom-free patient underwent curative hepatic resection 5 years after abdominoperineal resection for a rectal carcinoid.
 Twenty resections were palliative (gross residual tumor); 16 patients had symptomatic endocrinopathies and 4 patients had symptoms caused by the primary tumor.
 Eight of 16 patients with symptomatic endocrinopathies obtained complete relief; five are alive at 2 to 30 months (mean, 11 months), with a mean duration of complete relief of 6 months (3 to 12 months).
 All four patients who underwent resection for symptoms caused by the primary tumor obtained complete relief; two are alive and symptom free at 10 and 101 months.
 Our experience suggests that curative surgery should be considered in all patients with completely resectable metastatic disease and that palliative surgery, despite the short duration of complete relief, should be considered in selected patients because it delays and may reduce the subsequent need for medical therapy.

"Immunophenotypic characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid cells in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis.
 The presence of meningeal involvement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications.
 Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement.
 A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology.
 CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique.
 Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement.
 Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells.
 Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10.
 These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement.

"Cholecystectomy and right colon cancer in Puerto Rico.
 A case-control study was undertaken to evaluate the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and right colon cancer.
 Two hundred patients with adenocarcinoma of the cecum or ascending colon (diagnosed between 1984 and 1989) were compared with 200 matched neighborhood controls.
 Cholecystectomy history was obtained through interviews using structured questionnaires and subsequently validated from hospital records.
 A statistically significant association (odds ratio = 2.14) was found between right colon cancer and a history of prior cholecystectomy.
 The altered bile metabolism which occurs after removal of the gallbladder may have a carcinogenic effect on the right colon.
 Dietary habits of the colon cancer patients in our study were consistent with prior reports in the literature, showing that this group has a lower intake of vegetables and cereal fiber than the control population.

"A bleeding risk index for estimating the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting anticoagulant therapy.
 PURPOSE: To construct and test prospectively a bleeding risk index for estimating the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an inception cohort of 617 patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy in one hospital, data were gathered retrospectively and bleeding was classified using reliable explicit criteria.
 We constructed a bleeding risk index by identifying and weighting independent predictors of major bleeding using a multivariate proportional-hazards model.
 The bleeding risk index was tested in 394 other patients prospectively identified in a second hospital.
 The index was compared to physicians' predictions.
 RESULTS: Major bleeding developed before discharge in 61 of all 1,011 patients (6%).
 The bleeding risk index included four independent risk factors for major in-hospital bleeding: the number of specific comorbid conditions; heparin use in patients aged 60 years or older; maximal prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time 2.0 or more times control; liver dysfunction worsening during therapy.
 In the testing group, the index predicted major bleeding, which occurred in 3% of 235 low-risk patients, 16% of 96 middle-risk patients, and 19% of 63 high-risk patients (p less than 0.001).
 The bleeding risk index performed as well as physicians' predictions, and integration of the bleeding risk index with physicians' predictions led to a classification system that was more sensitive (p = 0.03) than physicians' predictions alone.
 In 86% of patients with a high risk of major bleeding, we identified specific ways of improving therapy, e.g., avoiding overanticoagulation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.
 CONCLUSION: The bleeding risk index provides valid estimates of the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy and complements physicians' predictions.
 The possibility that bleeding can be prevented in high-risk patients warrants prospective evaluation.

"Function after amputation, arthrodesis, or arthroplasty for tumors about the knee.
 We studied the function of twenty-two patients who had had a malignant skeletal tumor adjacent to the knee.
 An above-the-knee amputation was done in seven; a resection arthrodesis, in nine; and a replacement arthroplasty, in six.
 The patients all walked at a similar speed (sixty-one to sixty-six meters per minute), which is slower than normal (eighty meters per minute).
 They all walked with comparable efficiency at three velocities: the mean consumption of oxygen was 0.210 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter at free velocity, 0.215 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 25 per cent faster, and 0.211 to 0.240 milliliter per kilogram of body weight per meter when they walked 50 per cent faster.
 The three groups of patients and a normal control group consumed oxygen at similar rates.
 The patients who had had an amputation were very active, and they were the least worried about damaging the affected limb, but they had difficulty walking on steep, rough, or slippery surfaces.
 The patients who had had an arthrodesis had a more stable limb and performed the most demanding physical work and recreational activities, but they had difficulty sitting.
 The patients who had had an arthroplasty led sedentary lives and were the most protective of the limb, but they were the least self-conscious about the limb.

"Absorption and motility of the bypassed human ileum.
 The authors assessed absorption and motility of the human ileum after a prolonged period of disuse.
 In eight patients with ulcerative colitis, a manometric-catheter assembly was placed via the ileostomy into the unused portion of distal ileum two months after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and temporary diverting loop ileostomy.
 The distal ileum was perfused at 5 ml/min with an isosmotic solution of either sodium chloride or ileal chyme diluted with sodium chloride for three hours before and three hours after a meal on two consecutive days.
 Absorption was measured, single and clustered pressure waves were identified and quantitated with the aid of a computer program, and a motility index was calculated.
 Mean absorption +/- S.E.M.
 of both perfusates was poor on day 1 (-10 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min), and the meal induced no ileal motor response.
 By day 2, however, absorption of both perfusates was much improved (-1 +/- 2 ml/25 cm x 30 min; P less than 0.05), and the number of discrete clustered contractions and the motility index now clearly increased after the meal (2.6 +/- 0.6 vs.
 7.2 +/- 1.0 clustered waves/hr; 7.5 +/- 0.5 vs.
 9.7 +/- 0.2 motility units/30 min; P less than 0.05).
 The conclusion was that absorption and motility of the human ileum were impaired after two months of disuse, but that ileal absorption and motility improved one day after the introduction of isosmotic ileal perfusates.

"Guidelines for transfusion support in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Transfusion Practices Committee of the American Association of Blood Banks.
 We have reviewed the impact of evolving issues in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) on transfusion support for these patients.
 Issues include increased awareness of transfusion risks, reappraisal of traditional indicators triggering transfusion, and evolving alternatives to homologous blood transfusion such as autologous blood and pharmacologic therapy.
 These issues have been prompted by programs, such as the National Institutes of Health Consensus Conferences, to provide physicians with guidelines for appropriate use of blood components.
 However, evidence suggests that transfusion practice in coronary artery bypass grafting procedures remains variable and does not take into account the results of recently published clinical studies.
 We have therefore developed guidelines and recommendations for transfusion support in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.
 In summary, they are the following.
 1.
 Institutions with coronary artery bypass grafting programs should establish a multidisciplinary approach to use a combination of interventions designed to minimize homologous blood exposure.
 2.
 Prophylactic transfusion of plasma and platelets are of no benefit and therefore carry an unnecessary risk to the patient.
 3.
 Special request products such as designated blood donation from first-degree relatives should not be used because of the risk of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease.
 4.
 For support of intravascular volume, crystalloids or colloids should be used because they do not have the potential to transmit infection.

"Primary chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy and/or surgery for children with localized sarcoma of the bladder, prostate, vagina, uterus, and cervix. A comparison of the results in Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies I and II.
 A major objective of the second Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS-II) (1978 to 1984) was to preserve the bladder without compromising the survival of children with localized genitourinary sarcomas arising in or near the bladder.
 After incisional biopsy, 109 patients with localized, gross residual sarcoma of the prostate (43 patients), bladder (43 patients), vagina (20 patients), or cervix/uterine corpus (3 patients) were treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC).
 After two to four drug courses, radiation therapy and/or surgery were used to treat patients with residual or recurrent tumor.
 The 3-year survival rate of patients treated on this primary chemotherapy regimen (70%) was similar to that of the primary surgery regimens of IRS-I (78%; P = 0.46), but the 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly inferior (52% versus 70%; P = 0.02).
 Since the IRS-II encouraged bladder preservation at the onset of therapy, the percentage of patients with bladder and prostate tumors who retained the bladder was initially substantially higher in IRS-II (97%) than in IRS-I (58%).
 However, the percentages of 95 patients with bladder-prostate (BP) tumors in IRS-II who retained the bladder and were alive at 2 and 3 years after starting treatment were only 33% and 22%, respectively, compared with 26% and 23%, respectively, in the 66 patients with BP tumors in IRS-I.
 Thus, sequential treatment with primary chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy and/or surgery as given in IRS-II, failed to improve the eventual bladder salvage rate.

"Small fenestra stapedotomy using a fiberoptic hand-held argon laser in obliterative otosclerosis.
 Obliterative otosclerosis has been a challenge since the advent of stapes surgery.
 ""Drill-out"" procedures have had a generally poorer prognosis than conventional stapes surgery because of excessive bleeding, acoustic trauma from the burr, and reclosure of the oval window by otosclerosis.
 In this report, we describe our early experience using a hand-held fiberoptic argon laser for small fenestra stapedotomy in 10 cases of obliterative otosclerosis.
 Closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was seen in 100% of the patients.
 There was no significant sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo, or facial weakness.
 Argon-laser stapedotomy using a hand-held fiberoptic system is a safe and effective alternative to drill-out stapedotomy in cases of obliterative otosclerosis.

"Breast cancer screening: who should be included?
 The recommendations of the U.S.
 Preventive Services Task Force are reviewed in regard to screening for breast cancer.
 In contradistinction to those issued by some other national organizations, screening for breast cancer using mammography at ages 40-49 is not recommended.
 It is concluded that the scientific evidence is insufficient at present to recommend mammography screening for women aged 40-49.
 The recommendations of the task force are: all women over age 40 should receive an annual breast examination; all women should have mammography every one or two years beginning at age 50 and concluding at approximately age 75 unless disease has been detected; and it may be prudent to begin mammography at an earlier age for women at high risk of breast cancer.
 These recommendations are appropriate in light of the available evidence; though at present there is no evidence that clinical examination of the breasts at any age reduces breast cancer mortality; the upper age beyond which breast cancer screening no longer has a significant effect in reducing breast cancer mortality is unknown; and there is no evidence that women at high risk for breast cancer benefit to a different degree from screening than women not at high risk.

"Hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function.
 Hepatic malignancies often infiltrate to the major hepatic vein.
 Recently, we performed hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving remnant liver function in three such patients.
 One patient had a saphenous vein graft.
 Postoperative liver function of the patients who underwent hepatic vein reconstruction was compared with those of eight patients who underwent hepatic resection of segments VII and VIII.
 The right hepatic vein in four of them was resected and in the remaining four was preserved by skeletalization using an ultrasonic aspirator.
 Although four patients with right hepatic vein resection showed severe lowering of liver function after surgery, the postoperative course of patients with preservation or reconstruction of the right hepatic vein maintained good liver function.
 Liver regeneration of three patients with hepatic vein reconstruction was good on computed tomography.
 Besides this report, to our knowledge, there is no other report of hepatic vein reconstruction for preserving the remnant liver function.
 Problems with hepatic resection combined with hepatic vein reconstruction are discussed.
 We conclude that hepatic vein reconstruction is one of the means for extending indication of the malignant tumor resection of the liver.

"Increased susceptibility to hypoxia of prolonged action potential duration in ventricular papillary muscles from diabetic rats.
 The action potential duration (APD) of ventricular muscles obtained from diabetic animals is reported to be prolonged.
 We studied the effect of varied periods of diabetes on APD prolongation using isolated ventricular papillary muscles from streptozocin-injected rats.
 We found that a diabetic period greater than 30 wk was necessary for the evolution of significant prolongation of APD.
 We then studied the effect of repeated hypoxia (PO2 40 mmHg) and normoxia (PO2 300 mmHg) on prolonged APD of diabetic muscles and compared the findings with those from control rats.
 Transmembrane potentials were recorded with conventional glass microelectrodes.
 Under normoxic conditions, the APDs of diabetic muscles were significantly prolonged, the maximum upstroke velocity of action potentials tended to be decreased, and the resting membrane potential was not changed significantly compared with controls.
 The first hypoxia (20 min) shortened the APD in both diabetic and control rats but more so in diabetic rats, thereby making the APD of diabetic rats virtually identical to the control rat APD during the hypoxia.
 On subsequent reoxygenation (30 min), these hypoxia-induced changes were almost recovered.
 The second hypoxia (20 min) produced more severe shortening of the APD in both muscle types, and the effect was again far greater in diabetic rats than controls, ending with a reversed sequence of APDs and the APD of diabetic muscles much shorter than the controls.
 Excessive shortening of APD in diabetic muscles during hypoxic conditions was speculated to be due to greater increases in the outward K+ current through ATP-regulated K+ channels that may be secondary to the more severe reduction of intracellular ATP concentrations in diabetic versus control hearts.

"Annual summary of vital statistics--1989.
 US infant mortality continued to decline slowly and the provisional 1989 rate, 9.7 per 1000 live births, was the lowest ever recorded.
 Final 1988 data showed no change in cause of death distribution or in the wide discrepancy between white and black infant mortality.
 State rates varied from 6.8 in Vermont to 12.6 in Georgia.
 Worldwide, the US rate of 10.0 was bettered by 21 other countries, with Japan lowest at 4.8.
 Births increased in number and rate, because of a higher fertility rate and more women in the childbearing years.
 The birth rate to mothers 17 years of age and younger increased again.
 The proportion of women who had no or inadequate prenatal care was essentially unchanged.
 Deaths, crude death rate, and age-adjusted death rate decreased.
 The excess of births over deaths added almost 1.9 million persons to the US population, the highest rate of natural increase since 1971.
 The marriage rate was essentially unchanged, whereas the divorce rate decreased slightly, to the lowest level since 1973.
 With the exception of human immunodeficiency virus infection, homicide, and pulmonary malignancies, rates for most causes of death declined from 1988 to 1989.
 In comparison with 1940, most declines were substantial, led by pneumonia, down about 80%, and perinatal conditions, down about 75%.

 Neurogenic bladder is a frequent occurrence.
 A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results.
 The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder.
 Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability.
 In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding.
 Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier.
